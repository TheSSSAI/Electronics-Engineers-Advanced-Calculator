"RISK-001","Technical","A vulnerability in the `isolated-vm` library or its implementation could allow a malicious user-defined formula to escape the AWS Lambda sandbox, leading to remote code execution and compromise of the execution environment.","3","5","15","High","Secure execution of all user-defined custom modes (REQ-1-018), impacting the core value of the user-extensible framework.","Reliance on a single library for sandboxing untrusted code, and the inherent complexity of creating a perfectly secure execution environment.","Implement a multi-layered defense: 1) Strict validation of formula syntax on the backend before sending to Lambda. 2) Enforce a minimal, least-privilege IAM role for the Lambda function with no database or network access. 3) Regularly update the `isolated-vm` dependency and Node.js runtime via automated SCA scanning in the CI pipeline.","If a vulnerability is discovered, immediately disable the custom formula execution feature via a feature flag. Rotate all credentials potentially exposed in the Lambda environment. Initiate a full security audit of the sandboxing implementation.","CloudWatch alarms for unusual Lambda behavior (e.g., execution duration > 1000ms, high memory usage, any outbound network traffic attempts). Specific error patterns logged from the `isolated-vm` execution.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The complex logic for offline data synchronization, particularly the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution strategy (REQ-1-015), contains edge-case bugs that could lead to silent user data loss or corruption when syncing after intermittent connectivity.","4","4","16","High","Reliability of user data persistence for history, variables, and custom modes (REQ-1-014, US-060). User trust is heavily impacted by data loss.","Inherent difficulty in managing distributed state between client (IndexedDB) and server, especially with potential clock skew and race conditions.","Develop a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress that specifically targets offline scenarios. Use `cy.intercept()` to simulate network failures and `cy.exec()` to manipulate client-side clocks to test conflict resolution. Implement robust client-side logging to aid in debugging user-reported issues.","Establish a support workflow for users reporting data loss. Develop a runbook for engineers to manually inspect database backups (using PITR) to investigate and potentially restore lost data for critical cases.","An increase in API error rates on sync-related endpoints. Client-side error monitoring (e.g., Sentry) capturing exceptions within the sync service worker or IndexedDB logic.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The complex CI/CD pipeline (REQ-1-064) has multiple potential failure points (flaky E2E tests, false positives from security scanners, Terraform state locks) that could block all deployments, halting the release of features and critical bug fixes.","4","4","16","High","All development and deployment activities. A blocked pipeline directly impacts project velocity and ability to respond to production incidents.","High degree of automation and many integrated stages create a complex, single-path-to-production that is vulnerable to failure in any single step.","Implement a 'flaky test quarantine' policy. Configure security scanners to have a manual override mechanism for known false positives. Document and practice a 'break-glass' emergency manual deployment procedure for critical hotfixes. Use Terraform's remote state locking to prevent concurrent modification issues.","If the automated pipeline is blocked for more than 2 hours, execute the emergency manual deployment procedure for any critical changes. Assign a dedicated engineer to diagnose and fix the pipeline as their top priority.","GitHub Actions workflow failure notifications sent to a dedicated engineering Slack/Teams channel. A workflow run-time exceeding a predefined threshold (e.g., 30 minutes).","DevOps Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The P95 latency requirement of <500ms for custom formula execution (REQ-1-043) may be consistently missed due to AWS Lambda cold starts, especially under sporadic load, leading to a poor user experience for a key differentiating feature.","3","4","12","Medium","Performance and usability of the custom mode execution feature (US-047), a key part of the user-extensible framework.","The serverless, on-demand nature of AWS Lambda can introduce variable initialization latency (cold starts) that is outside the application's direct control.","Proactively configure AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for the production environment to keep a set number of execution environments warm. Conduct targeted load testing on the formula execution endpoint to tune the concurrency level and verify P95 latency.","If latency targets are still missed, temporarily increase the Lambda function's allocated memory to improve CPU performance. If the issue persists, investigate code-level optimizations within the Lambda handler for faster initialization.","A CloudWatch alarm on the P95 latency for the `FormulaExecutionService` Lambda function, with a threshold set to 450ms.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","A major outage in a critical AWS service within the `us-east-1` region (e.g., Cognito, RDS, ECS) could render the application completely unavailable, violating the 99.9% availability SLA and the 4-hour Recovery Time Objective (RTO).","2","5","10","Medium","Overall application availability (REQ-1-050) and disaster recovery objectives (REQ-1-045).","Dependency on a single cloud provider and region for all production infrastructure.","Strictly adhere to the requirement for Multi-AZ deployments for all stateful (RDS) and compute (ECS) services. Ensure database Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) is enabled. Document and regularly test a disaster recovery plan for failing over to a secondary region.","In the event of a confirmed regional outage, execute the disaster recovery plan to provision infrastructure and restore data in a secondary region. Communicate with users via a third-party hosted status page.","AWS Health Dashboard notifications for the primary region. Alerts from an external, third-party uptime monitoring service (e.g., Pingdom) indicating widespread endpoint failure.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","Failure to meet the WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standard (REQ-1-034) could result in a product that is unusable for a segment of the population, leading to legal risks and reputational damage.","3","4","12","Medium","Overall product quality, usability, and legal compliance. Affects all user-facing components, especially complex ones like the custom mode wizard and dynamic calculators.","Accessibility is a specialized skill set; the development team may lack sufficient expertise, and automated tools cannot catch all issues.","Integrate automated accessibility testing (e.g., `axe-core`) into the E2E test suite. Mandate manual keyboard-only and screen reader testing as part of the Definition of Done for all new UI features. Provide targeted training for frontend developers on ARIA patterns and semantic HTML.","If a major accessibility issue is found post-release, prioritize the fix as a critical bug. Engage a third-party accessibility consultant to perform an audit and provide remediation guidance.","Failures in the automated accessibility checks within the CI pipeline. Regular (e.g., quarterly) manual audits of core user flows using screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver).","Lead Frontend Engineer","2025-04-10","Not Started"
