"1","Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Experience","Establish foundational infrastructure (Terraform, CI/CD), a full user authentication system (Cognito), and a functional, anonymous-user core calculator.","2024-10-28","2024-11-08","10","18","181","160","113%","21","User Account & Authentication, Core Calculator Functionality","Live `dev` environment with Cognito User Pool; Functional login/logout flow; Basic calculator with arithmetic and history for anonymous users.","Demonstrate user registration and login. Show a basic calculation (e.g., '5+3*2=11') and its appearance in the history panel.","All foundational tasks complete. US-053 and US-001 acceptance criteria met. E2E tests for login and basic calculation are passing in CI.","High capacity utilization; Complexity of Cognito OAuth2+PKCE integration; Parallel setup of FE, BE, and Infra.","Prioritize critical path tasks first. Encourage close collaboration between FE/BE/DevOps. Accept that some lower-priority tasks may spill over.","true","devops.lead@company.com,backend.dev1@company.com,frontend.dev1@company.com,frontend.dev2@company.com,qa.engineer@company.com","AWS service availability","Continuous integration between FE and BE throughout the sprint.","2024-11-08 at 2:00 PM","2024-11-08","Complete 50% of hours by end of day 5."
"2","Sprint 2: Data Persistence & Custom Mode Creation","Enable full persistence of user data for History and Custom Modes.
