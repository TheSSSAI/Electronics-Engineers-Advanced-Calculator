"RISK-001","Technical","A vulnerability in the `isolated-vm` library or its implementation could allow a malicious user-defined formula to escape the AWS Lambda sandbox, leading to remote code execution.","Medium","Critical","[""SEC-003-T1"",""SEC-005-T1""]","3","Enforce a minimal, least-privilege IAM role for the Lambda. Mandate a formal security review by an external specialist before go-live.","Immediately disable the custom formula execution feature via a feature flag and rotate all credentials.","CloudWatch alarms for unusual Lambda behavior (e.g., execution duration > 1000ms).","5000","1 week to implement mitigation."
"RISK-002","Quality","The complex logic for offline data synchronization contains edge-case bugs that could lead to silent user data loss or corruption when syncing after intermittent connectivity.","High","High","[""US060-T1"",""US060-T2"",""TEST-E2E-03""]","2","Develop a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress that specifically targets offline scenarios, including manipulating client-side clocks to test conflict resolution.","Establish a support workflow for users reporting data loss and develop a runbook for engineers to manually inspect database backups.","An increase in API error rates on sync-related endpoints or client-side error monitoring alerts.","","3 weeks to implement mitigation."
"RISK-003","Timeline","The complex CI/CD pipeline has multiple potential failure points (flaky E2E tests, security scanner false positives) that could block all deployments, halting the release of features and critical bug fixes.","High","High","[""All deployment tasks""]","4","Implement a 'flaky test quarantine' policy. Document and practice a 'break-glass' emergency manual deployment procedure for critical hotfixes.","Execute the emergency manual deployment procedure for any critical changes if the pipeline is blocked for more than 2 hours.","GitHub Actions workflow failure notifications sent to a dedicated engineering channel.","","1 week to implement mitigation."
