"RISK-001","Technical","A security vulnerability in the 'isolated-vm' library or an improper sandbox configuration in the Formula Execution Service (Lambda) could allow malicious user-defined code to escape the sandbox, leading to data exfiltration, denial of service, or compromise of the AWS environment.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-040"",""TASK-041""]","4","Mandate rigorous code reviews by a security champion. Implement multi-layered Lambda security (minimal IAM, no network access, aggressive limits). Integrate automated dependency scanning for 'isolated-vm'.","Implement a feature flag to immediately disable the custom formula execution endpoint. Prepare a hotfix deployment process.","CloudWatch Alarms on Lambda error rates > 5% or invocation duration approaching timeout.","25000","1 week to implement mitigation."
"RISK-003","Resource","Key person dependency on the single DevOps Engineer creates a critical bottleneck for all infrastructure and CI/CD tasks, risking significant project-wide delays if they become unavailable.","High","High","[""TASK-004"",""TASK-005"",""TASK-006"",""TASK-007"",""TASK-008"",""TASK-009"",""TASK-010"",""TASK-011"",""TASK-012"",""TASK-013"",""TASK-014""]","3","1. Prioritize comprehensive documentation for all Terraform modules and CI/CD workflows. 2. Schedule dedicated cross-training sessions (4 hours/sprint) with a backend developer. 3. Pre-approve a contract with an on-demand DevOps consultant for emergencies.","If the resource is lost, activate the on-demand consultant and have the cross-trained backend developer manage day-to-day pipeline operations.","DevOps tasks in Sprint 1 are delayed by more than 3 days.","20000","4 weeks for initial cross-training."
"RISK-004","Quality","Failure to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirements could result in a product that is unusable for a segment of the audience, leading to legal and reputational risk.","High","Medium","[""TASK-050"",""TASK-051"",""TASK-052""]","2","Integrate automated accessibility testing (Axe-core) into CI/CD. Conduct mandatory training for all frontend developers. Include manual screen reader testing in the Definition of Done for all UI stories.","Allocate budget for a third-party accessibility audit before launch and maintain a prioritized backlog of accessibility issues.","Automated accessibility scans in CI begin to fail consistently.","10000","Ongoing through project."
