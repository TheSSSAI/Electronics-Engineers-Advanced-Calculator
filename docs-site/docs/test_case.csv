"TEST-AUTH-001","User Authentication","Security","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the complete OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE for user login, ensuring secure token exchange and session creation as per REQ-1-039.","High - Compromised authentication flow could lead to unauthorized access to all user data.","High","AWS Cognito User Pool is configured with a test user account. Staging environment is deployed.","1. Intercept network traffic. 2. Navigate to login. 3. Verify redirect to Cognito with `code_challenge`. 4. Enter valid credentials. 5. Verify redirect back to app with `authorization_code`. 6. Verify client POSTs to token endpoint with `code_verifier`. 7. Verify JWTs are received and stored in-memory. 8. Verify subsequent API calls include the JWT in the Authorization header.","User successfully logs in, and all steps of the PKCE flow are correctly executed. Session is established and protected API endpoints are accessible.","Valid Cognito test user credentials.","Cypress, Browser Developer Tools","6","16","4","REQ-1-029 (AWS Cognito), REQ-1-040 (JWT access control)","Staging environment with Cognito integration.","100% adherence to the PKCE flow as verified by network traffic inspection.

"TEST-SEC-001","Custom Formula Execution","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the secure formula execution sandbox (REQ-1-018) prevents access to disallowed functions and objects, mitigating the risk of sandbox escape.","Critical - A sandbox escape could lead to a full system compromise.","High","The Formula Execution Service (Lambda) is deployed. API Gateway is configured.","1. Craft a custom mode with a formula attempting to access `process.exit()`. 2. Send request to the execution endpoint. 3. Verify the API returns a security or reference error. 4. Repeat for other disallowed objects like `Math.random()`, `fetch`, etc. 5. Verify `isolated-vm` is used and `vm2` is not a dependency.","The Lambda function catches the attempt to use disallowed functions and returns a structured error message. The sandbox is not compromised.","JSON payloads for custom modes with various malicious formulas.","Supertest (for backend API test), AWS SDK","8","20","5","REQ-1-018 (Sandbox), REQ-1-019 (Allow-list)","Integration environment with deployed Lambda and API Gateway.","All attempts to use disallowed functions/objects fail with a security error.

"TEST-OFFLINE-001","Offline Data Synchronization","Functional","E2E","High","true","High","Verify the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution for mutable data (e.g., user variables) during offline synchronization as per REQ-1-015.","High - Incorrect implementation can lead to user data loss, destroying user trust.","High","User is logged in. Application is loaded.","1. In Session A, set variable `X=1`. 2. In Session A, simulate network offline. 3. In Session A, update `X=2`. Verify change is queued in IndexedDB. 4. In a separate Session B (online), update variable `X=3`. 5. In Session A, simulate network online. 6. Verify Session A attempts to sync `X=2`, receives a 409 Conflict, and updates its local state to `X=3` (the server's authoritative value).","The final value of variable X is 3 in both sessions, demonstrating that the server-authoritative, last-write-wins strategy was correctly enforced.","A logged-in test user account.","Cypress (with network interception capabilities)","8","24","8","REQ-1-014 (Offline Storage), REQ-1-015 (Conflict Resolution)","Staging environment.","100% data consistency after conflict resolution.

"TEST-ACC-001","Accessibility","Accessibility","E2E","High","","Low","Manually verify the entire user registration and custom mode creation wizard flows using only a keyboard and a screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver), ensuring compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA.","Medium - Failure to comply can lead to legal issues and alienate users with disabilities.","Medium","Application deployed to staging environment.","1. Start a screen reader. 2. Navigate to the registration page using only the Tab key. 3. Fill out all fields, handle validation errors, and submit the form. 4. Navigate to the custom mode creation wizard. 5. Complete all steps of the wizard (name, variables, formulas) using only the keyboard. 6.
