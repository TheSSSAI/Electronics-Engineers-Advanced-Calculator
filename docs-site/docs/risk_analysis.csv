"RISK-001","Technical","A security vulnerability in the 'isolated-vm' library or an improper sandbox configuration in the Formula Execution Service (Lambda) could allow malicious user-defined code to escape the sandbox, leading to data exfiltration, denial of service, or compromise of the AWS environment.","3","5","15","High","WI-040: Backend: Implement Secure Formula Execution Lambda, WI-041: Backend: Implement Custom Mode Execution Endpoint, EPIC-005: User-Extensible Custom Modes","Execution of untrusted, user-provided code is inherently risky. The complexity of V8 isolates and the sandboxing library introduces potential for subtle but critical configuration errors or library vulnerabilities.","1. Mandate rigorous code reviews for all sandbox-related code by a designated security champion. 2. Implement a multi-layered security configuration for the Lambda function: minimal IAM permissions, no VPC/network access, and aggressive memory/timeout limits. 3. Integrate automated dependency scanning (SCA via Snyk/npm audit) specifically for 'isolated-vm' to be alerted of new CVEs.","Implement a feature flag to immediately disable the custom formula execution endpoint via API Gateway if a critical vulnerability is discovered. Prepare a hotfix deployment process to patch the Lambda function. Maintain a backlog task to research alternative sandboxing technologies.","CloudWatch Alarms on Lambda error rates exceeding 5%, invocation duration approaching the timeout limit, or any logs indicating a sandbox crash or unexpected error.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The offline data synchronization logic, particularly the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution, may be implemented incorrectly, leading to data loss or corruption for users with intermittent connectivity or who use multiple devices. This can severely damage user trust.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-048: Backend: Implement 'Last-Write-Wins' Conflict Resolution, WI-047: Frontend: Implement Online/Offline Detection and Sync Trigger, EPIC-006: Offline Capability & Data Synchronization","Distributed state management with conflict resolution is a complex problem. Race conditions, client-side clock skew, and edge cases in network transitions can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to detect.","1. The backend must be the authoritative source for timestamps; never trust client-generated timestamps for conflict resolution. 2. Implement robust end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress that simulate offline/online transitions and concurrent edits. 3. Add detailed, structured logging around the conflict resolution logic to trace decisions.","If a critical data corruption bug is found, disable the offline modification feature for mutable data via a feature flag, making it read-only offline. Prepare a data-migration script to potentially fix corrupted records for affected users based on logs.","An increase in 409 Conflict API responses, which indicates frequent conflicts. User bug reports related to 'lost' variables or custom modes.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Delays in setting up the foundational infrastructure (IaC) and the CI/CD pipeline could create a significant bottleneck, blocking all application feature development and jeopardizing the overall project timeline. ","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-001: Project Scaffolding & Foundational Infrastructure, which is a dependency for all other Epics (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, etc.).","The infrastructure and deployment pipeline are complex, involving numerous AWS services and automation scripts (Terraform, GitHub Actions). They are on the critical path for the entire project.","1. Assign dedicated DevOps/Cloud engineering resources to EPIC-001 from day one. 2. Prioritize a 'minimum viable pipeline' that allows developers to deploy to a dev environment early, then iterate on more advanced features (Blue/Green, security scanning). 3. Use modular Terraform design to allow parallel work on different infrastructure components.","Develop a documented manual deployment process for the development environment as a temporary fallback to unblock developers if the automated pipeline is delayed. This process should be considered a temporary measure with high technical debt.","The 'Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform' workstream (WS-002) is not completed by the end of the first sprint. CI/CD workflow (WS-003) is not functional for a basic deployment by the end of the second sprint.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Failure to meet the stringent WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirements across all components could result in a product that is unusable for a segment of the target audience, leading to legal compliance issues and reputational damage.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-050, WI-051, WI-052 (Accessibility Compliance). Affects all frontend work items (WI-001, WI-015, WI-023, etc.).","Achieving and maintaining high accessibility standards requires specialized expertise and continuous effort throughout the development lifecycle, which is often underestimated. It cannot be 'bolted on' at the end.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing (e.g., Axe-core) into the CI pipeline to catch common issues early. 2. Conduct mandatory accessibility training for all frontend developers. 3. Dedicate specific story points in each sprint for accessibility audits and remediation of new components. 4. Incorporate manual testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) into the Definition of Done for all UI-related stories.","Allocate budget for a third-party accessibility audit before the v1.0 launch. Maintain a prioritized backlog of known accessibility issues to be addressed in post-launch patches.","Automated accessibility scans in the CI pipeline begin to fail consistently. Manual QA reports an increase in accessibility-related defects.","QA Lead","2024-09-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","A critical vulnerability is discovered in a core third-party dependency (e.g., NestJS, `isolated-vm`, or a key Material-UI component), forcing an immediate and unplanned upgrade or replacement that could destabilize the application and significantly delay the project timeline.","2","5","10","Medium","All work items. A vulnerability in NestJS affects the entire backend; a vulnerability in React affects the entire frontend.","The project relies on a wide ecosystem of open-source software, which introduces a dependency on the security posture and maintenance of external projects.","1. Implement automated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the CI pipeline (REQ-1-048) to continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities. 2. Maintain a policy of using only LTS or stable versions of major frameworks. 3. Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date through a regular (e.g., monthly) dependency review and update process.","Maintain an 'emergency patch' process for deploying security fixes outside of the regular release cycle. For critical components like the sandboxing library, have a research spike in the backlog to evaluate a secondary alternative.","A high or critical severity vulnerability alert from the SCA tool (Snyk, `npm audit`) in the CI pipeline.","Tech Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project requires a diverse and advanced skillset (React, NestJS, AWS, Terraform, `isolated-vm`, Accessibility). A lack of expertise or a key person dependency in any of these areas could lead to low-quality implementation, security flaws, and project delays.","3","3","9","Medium","All Epics, particularly EPIC-001 (Infrastructure), EPIC-005 (Custom Modes), and EPIC-007 (Quality).","The technology stack is modern but broad, requiring 'full-stack' developers who are also proficient in DevOps, security, and accessibility.","1. Conduct a team skills matrix assessment early in the project. 2. Promote pair programming and mandatory code reviews, especially on critical components like security and infrastructure. 3. Allocate a budget for specialized training or external consultation for complex areas like `isolated-vm` sandboxing and WCAG compliance.","Have a pre-approved budget for bringing in short-term contract specialists if a critical skill gap is identified that blocks progress. Cross-train team members on critical systems to reduce key person dependency.","Consistently slow progress or high bug counts in a specific area of the project (e.g., Terraform, Accessibility tickets). A key team member resigns.","Engineering Manager","2024-05-30","Not Started"
