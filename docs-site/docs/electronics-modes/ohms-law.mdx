# Ohm's Law & Power Calculator

The Ohm's Law & Power mode is a specialized tool designed to simplify one of the most fundamental calculations in electronics. It allows you to solve for any two variables in the Ohm's Law and Power Law equations by providing the other two.

The core formulas used are:
-   **Ohm's Law**: `Voltage = Current × Resistance` (`V = IR`)
-   **Power Law**: `Power = Voltage × Current` (`P = VI`)
