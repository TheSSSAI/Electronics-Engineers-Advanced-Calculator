"Cross-training DevOps Skills","Single point of failure with one DevOps Engineer responsible for all infrastructure and CI/CD.","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for the DevOps Engineer to cross-train one Backend Developer (e.g., backend.dev2) on Terraform and GitHub Actions workflow management.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 50%. Creates a backup resource for pipeline maintenance and minor infrastructure changes.","40","10 weeks","The backend developer can independently make and deploy a minor Terraform change by the end of the project.","Avoids potential project delays valued at over $100,000 if the primary DevOps resource becomes unavailable."
"Frontend Workload Balancing","Sprint 5 shows significant overallocation for both frontend developers (102% and 108% utilization based on estimated hours).","Re-balance Sprint 5 tasks. Move lower priority or non-dependent tasks (e.g., TASK-056 'Set up Docusaurus Project') to a new Sprint 6, or re-assign a less complex task like TASK-043 to a backend developer with frontend interest.","Reduces burnout risk, provides capacity buffer for unforeseen complexity in high-risk tasks like offline sync, and improves timeline predictability.","","Immediate (in next planning session)","Sprint 5 utilization for both frontend developers is brought below 85%.","Prevents schedule slip in the final, most critical sprint, ensuring on-time delivery."
