"RISK-001","Technical","A zero-day vulnerability in the `isolated-vm` library could allow a malicious user-defined formula to escape the V8 Isolate sandbox, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the AWS Lambda environment and a compromise of backend services.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-003: Secure Formula Execution Service, US-047: Launch and use a custom calculation mode","Reliance on a single third-party library for a critical security boundary against untrusted code execution from arbitrary users.","1. Ensure the Lambda execution role has zero IAM permissions beyond basic execution and logging. 2. Pin the `isolated-vm` version and only upgrade after careful review of changes. 3. Subscribe to security advisories for V8 and the library itself.","If a critical vulnerability is announced, immediately disable the custom formula execution endpoint via API Gateway. Prepare and deploy an emergency patch to update the library or temporarily disable the feature.","High-priority security alerts from GitHub Dependabot or Snyk for the `isolated-vm` package.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","A bug in the backend's authorization logic, such as a missing `WHERE user_id = ?` clause, could allow one user to access or modify another user's private data (history, variables, custom modes), leading to a critical data breach.","3","5","15","High","WS-004: User Data & Custom Modes API, US-054, US-055, US-056","Human error in implementing authorization logic consistently across all data-accessing API endpoints in a multi-tenant architecture.","1. Implement a reusable NestJS guard or decorator to enforce resource ownership. 2. Standardize data access through a repository pattern that automatically scopes queries to the authenticated user. 3. Mandate peer reviews with a specific checklist item for authorization logic.","If a data leak is discovered, immediately take affected endpoints offline. Initiate incident response to identify the scope, notify users as required by GDPR/CCPA, and deploy a hotfix.","Failure of an automated integration test that specifically attempts to cross-access data between two distinct test user accounts.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Achieving full WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance is a complex, cross-cutting concern that is often underestimated. Leaving accessibility as an afterthought could require significant, costly refactoring late in the project, delaying the release.","4","4","16","High","WI-069: Implement Full WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance, All frontend development tasks in EPIC-004.","Treating accessibility as a final quality check rather than an integral part of the design and development process from the beginning.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing (Axe-core) into the CI pipeline from day one. 2. Conduct regular manual audits with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation. 3. Provide training for all frontend developers on ARIA and semantic HTML.","If major accessibility gaps are found late, de-scope non-critical features to allocate developer time to remediation. Engage an external accessibility consultant for an emergency audit and guidance.","The CI pipeline's automated accessibility scan reports new critical violations in a pull request.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The offline synchronization logic is complex. Bugs in queuing, conflict detection, or the 'last-write-wins' strategy could lead to user data being silently lost or overwritten incorrectly, severely damaging user trust and data integrity.","4","4","16","High","WI-068: Implement Offline Functionality and Synchronization, US-060, US-055, US-054","Inherent complexity of managing distributed state between the client (IndexedDB) and server, especially with potential for network interruptions and clock skew.","1. Develop a comprehensive suite of E2E tests that mock offline/online transitions and simulate conflict scenarios. 2. Rely on server-generated timestamps as the single source of truth for conflict resolution. 3. Implement robust logging on both client and server for sync operations.","If major data loss bugs are found post-launch, provide a UI mechanism for users to view and manually resolve sync conflicts as a temporary measure while a fix is developed.","CloudWatch alarms for a high rate of 409 Conflict responses from sync endpoints, which could indicate a client-side bug or clock skew issue.","Lead Full-Stack Engineer","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","A bug in the complex Blue/Green deployment script in GitHub Actions could fail mid-deployment, leaving production in an inconsistent state or causing an outage. A failed deployment would block all future releases until fixed.","3","5","15","High","WI-014: Implement 'Deploy' Stage with Blue/Green Strategy, All application deployments","High complexity of scripting interactions between multiple AWS services (Terraform, ECS, ALB) and the CI/CD platform to achieve zero-downtime deployment.","1. Thoroughly test the deployment script against the `staging` environment. 2. Implement manual approval gates in the GitHub Actions workflow for production deployments. 3. Write idempotent scripts with robust error handling and automated rollback steps.","Maintain a documented 'break-glass' procedure for performing a manual deployment or rollback using the AWS CLI and Terraform CLI directly, bypassing the automation script in an emergency.","A deployment workflow to the `staging` environment fails repeatedly.","DevOps Engineer","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The AWS Lambda function for formula execution may experience cold starts that cause the P95 latency to exceed the 500ms NFR (REQ-1-043), leading to a sluggish and poor user experience for the Custom Modes feature.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-041: Implement Lambda Handler with `isolated-vm`, US-047","The serverless, on-demand nature of AWS Lambda. The overhead of initializing the Node.js runtime and the `isolated-vm` library can be significant on a cold start.","1. Conduct load testing early to measure cold start impact. 2. Implement AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for the production environment to keep a set number of instances warm.","If Provisioned Concurrency is too expensive or ineffective, refactor the execution service into a long-running, containerized ECS Fargate task with a dedicated queue.","CloudWatch alarm on the P95 latency for the Formula Execution Lambda function breaching a 450ms threshold.","DevOps Engineer","2024-07-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project relies on highly specialized skills in `isolated-vm` security and complex Terraform architecture. The departure or unavailability of a key team member with this knowledge could halt progress in a critical area.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-003: Secure Formula Execution Service, WS-001: Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Setup","Concentration of critical, non-trivial knowledge in one or two individuals due to the specialized nature of the technologies chosen.","1. Mandate pair programming for complex tasks in these specialized areas. 2. Enforce thorough documentation for all complex infrastructure and security components. 3. Conduct internal knowledge-sharing sessions to cross-train other team members.","Have a pre-vetted list of external consultants or contractors who can be engaged on short notice to fill a critical skill gap.","Git commit history shows only one developer consistently contributing to a critical module (e.g., the Lambda sandbox or Terraform core networking).","Project Manager","2024-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Quality","An incorrectly configured Service Worker for offline mode could be difficult to debug and may cache an old version of the application, preventing users from receiving updates and bug fixes without manual intervention.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-068: Implement Offline Functionality and Synchronization","The complexity of the Service Worker lifecycle (install, activate, fetch) and caching strategies (cache-first, stale-while-revalidate) is prone to error.","1. Implement a robust cache-busting strategy for new deployments. 2. Provide a UI button for users to manually trigger a 'check for updates' and clear caches as a fallback. 3. Use established libraries like Workbox to manage the Service Worker lifecycle.","If users are stuck on an old version, publish a guide on how to manually unregister the Service Worker and clear site data for their specific browser.","An increase in user support tickets related to not seeing a newly released feature.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-08-01","Not Started"
