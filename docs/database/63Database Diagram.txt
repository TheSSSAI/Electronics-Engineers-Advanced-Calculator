This Entity-Relationship Diagram visualizes the database for the calculator application. The central 'User' entity is linked to three other entities: 'CustomMode', 'UserVariable', and 'CalculationHistory'. Each of these represents user-specific data, establishing a one-to-many relationship where one user can have multiple custom modes, variables, and history entries. This structure effectively segregates user data and supports features like offline synchronization and legal consent tracking.
