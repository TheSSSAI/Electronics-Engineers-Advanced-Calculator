This ER diagram models the relationships between a central User entity and their associated data. Each User can have multiple Custom Modes, User Variables, and Calculation History entries. These one-to-many relationships are identifying, meaning the child entities (CustomMode, UserVariable, CalculationHistory) are dependent on the parent User entity for their existence, with cascade deletes enabled.
