"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the `isolated-vm` sandbox implementation for the custom formula execution service could allow a malicious user to break out of the sandbox, leading to remote code execution on the Lambda environment or unauthorized data access.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-006-01-01: Implement Sandbox using `isolated-vm`, WI-006-02-02: Implement Custom Mode Execution UI","The inherent complexity of creating a secure execution sandbox and the potential for subtle misconfigurations in the `isolated-vm` library's API or resource limits.","1. Mandate strict peer reviews for all code related to the formula execution service. 2. Develop a comprehensive suite of 'hostile' unit tests designed to probe for escape vulnerabilities. 3. Commission a third-party security audit specifically targeting the Lambda sandbox implementation before public launch.","If a vulnerability is discovered, immediately disable the custom mode execution feature via a feature flag and an API Gateway route update. Revert to a known-secure version or keep the feature disabled until a patch is developed and verified.","Any new high or critical finding from automated security scans (SAST/SCA) on the formula execution service. Any unexpected error patterns or resource usage spikes from the Lambda function in CloudWatch.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-09-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Timeline","Delays in completing the foundational Infrastructure-as-Code setup (EPIC-001), particularly the VPC, RDS, Cognito, and ECS cluster, will create a cascading delay across the entire project as all application development is blocked.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005, EPIC-006 - Essentially the entire project.","Underestimation of the complexity of creating a secure, multi-environment, and production-ready AWS infrastructure using Terraform. Potential for a single DevOps resource to become a bottleneck.","1. Prioritize EPIC-001 in 'Sprint 0' with a dedicated infrastructure specialist. 2. Define infrastructure interfaces (e.g., database endpoints, Cognito IDs) early, allowing application developers to work against mocked or local-only versions. 3. Implement infrastructure in modular, testable pieces.","If significant delays occur, deploy a simplified 'dev-only' infrastructure manually or with minimal IaC to unblock application development, while continuing the production-grade Terraform work in parallel. This will incur technical debt but maintain project momentum.","Failure to complete key infrastructure work items (VPC, RDS, ECS) by the end of the first development sprint.","DevOps Lead / Tech Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The offline data synchronization logic, specifically the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution for mutable data, could cause unintentional data loss for users due to client-server clock skew or race conditions during rapid online/offline state changes.","4","4","16","High","WI-007-01-03: Implement Synchronization and Conflict Resolution","Reliance on client-side timestamps for conflict resolution is inherently unreliable. The 'last-write-wins' strategy is simple but can overwrite legitimate user changes made on a device that was offline longer.","1. Ensure the server is the authoritative source for timestamps; all updates must use a server-generated `updated_at` timestamp. 2. The client should send its known 'last-seen' timestamp with an update, allowing the server to detect and reject a stale write (returning a 409 Conflict). 3. The client must then gracefully handle the 409 by fetching the latest state from the server and notifying the user.","If data loss issues are found, switch the synchronization strategy for critical data from automatic to a manual, user-prompted merge, asking the user to choose which version ('local' or 'server') to keep.","An increase in 409 Conflict responses from the data synchronization endpoints. User reports of data 'reverting' or disappearing after coming back online.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-10-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The project fails to meet the stringent WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirement across the dynamic SPA, particularly in complex components like the custom mode wizard and dynamically rendered forms, leading to legal risk and excluding users with disabilities.","4","3","12","Medium","All frontend Work Items (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-005, EPIC-006).","Underestimation of the effort required for accessibility. Lack of continuous manual testing with screen readers. Complex UI components (e.g., custom mode wizard) are inherently difficult to make fully accessible.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing (e.g., Axe) into the E2E test suite. 2. Mandate accessibility-focused code reviews for all new UI components. 3. Allocate specific sprint time for manual accessibility testing with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation for every major feature.","If major accessibility gaps are found late in the project, create a public accessibility statement acknowledging the issues and defining a remediation roadmap. Prioritize fixing critical blockers before launch and schedule other fixes for a post-launch patch.","Automated accessibility scans in the CI/CD pipeline failing. Any new UI feature being developed without a corresponding accessibility test plan.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","Incorrect configuration of the AWS Cognito integration, specifically the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow, callback URLs, or token scope, results in a non-functional or insecure authentication system, blocking all user-specific features.","3","5","15","High","WI-001-01-03: Configure AWS Cognito with Terraform, WI-004-02-02: Integrate Cognito for Auth Flow (PKCE)","The OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow is complex and has multiple configuration points across Cognito and the client application that must be perfectly aligned. Small errors can lead to total authentication failure.","1. Prototype the Cognito integration early in the project. 2. Use a well-established OIDC client library on the frontend to handle the flow. 3. Implement extensive integration testing for the login, logout, and token refresh flows.","If the PKCE flow proves too difficult to stabilize, revert to a simpler (though less ideal for SPAs) Implicit flow temporarily to unblock development, with a mandatory task to reinstate PKCE before production.","High error rates on the Cognito token endpoint. E2E tests for login and registration failing consistently.","Full-Stack Engineer (Auth Specialist)","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The Blue/Green deployment process, managed by GitHub Actions, fails during a production traffic switch due to a bug in the scripting, load balancer configuration, or health checks, resulting in a production outage or deployment of a faulty version.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-001-02-03: Create CD Workflow for Blue/Green Deployment","Complexity of orchestrating traffic shifting across multiple services and validating the health of the new 'Green' environment under production-like conditions before the switch.","1. Thoroughly test the deployment scripts in a 'staging' environment that mirrors production. 2. Implement robust health checks on the new version before the traffic switch is approved. 3. Create a detailed runbook for manual rollback procedures in case of automation failure. 4. Conduct regular deployment drills.","If the Blue/Green mechanism fails, fall back to a simpler rolling update deployment strategy directly on the ECS service. This will incur a brief period of mixed versions but is less complex to execute manually.","Failure of the 'Health Check' stage in the CD pipeline. CloudWatch alarms for the 'Green' environment firing immediately after deployment.","DevOps Lead","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Performance","The P95 latency for the custom formula execution endpoint exceeds the 500ms NFR due to AWS Lambda cold starts, providing a poor user experience for the custom modes feature, especially under sparse usage patterns.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-006-01-01: Implement Sandbox using `isolated-vm`","AWS Lambda's serverless nature means that functions that are not invoked frequently can have a high startup latency ('cold start') while the environment is provisioned.","1. Implement performance and load testing specifically targeting the formula execution endpoint. 2. Monitor P95 latency in CloudWatch. 3. If the NFR is not met, enable AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for the function to keep a set number of instances warm and ready to execute.","If Provisioned Concurrency is too costly or ineffective, investigate refactoring the execution logic to be part of the main ECS backend service, accepting the security trade-off of less-strict isolation for better performance.","The P95 latency CloudWatch alarm for the formula execution Lambda function being triggered.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-10-31","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","The true complexity of the user-extensible custom modes feature (EPIC-006) is significantly underestimated, leading to resource constraints and a major delay in delivering this key product differentiator.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-006: User-Extensible Custom Modes","The feature is a combination of several complex workstreams: a secure sandbox, a dynamic UI wizard, a new execution UI, and import/export functionality, making it easy to underestimate the total effort.","1. Break down EPIC-006 into smaller, independently deliverable user stories. 2. Aggressively de-scope the v1 implementation; for example, release with only the wizard and execution, deferring import/export and advanced UI controls to v1.1. 3. Conduct a technical spike on the wizard UI and dynamic renderer early to better inform estimates.","If the feature is severely delayed, prepare a simplified version for the initial launch (e.g., only allowing single-formula modes with no complex UI) to meet the deadline, with the full feature set to follow in a subsequent release.","Failure to complete the first major work item of the epic (e.g., the creation wizard) within two sprints. Velocity metrics for the team working on this epic are consistently below projections.","Project Manager / Product Owner","2024-09-30","Not Started"
