"RISK-002","Timeline","Delays in completing the foundational Infrastructure-as-Code setup will create a cascading delay across the entire project as all application development is blocked.","Medium","High","[""TASK-052.2"",""TASK-053.1"",""TASK-053.2""]","2","Prioritize all infrastructure tasks in Sprint 1. Define infrastructure interfaces (endpoints, Cognito IDs) early, allowing developers to work against mocked versions.","Deploy a simplified 'dev-only' infrastructure manually to unblock development while production-grade Terraform work continues in parallel.","Failure to complete TASK-DEV-001.1 by day 5 of Sprint 1.","","1 week"
"RISK-003","Technical","The offline data synchronization logic, specifically the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution, could cause unintentional data loss for users due to client-server clock skew or race conditions.","High","High","[""TASK-060.1"",""TASK-060.2""]","1.5","Ensure the server is the authoritative source for timestamps. The client must handle a 409 Conflict by fetching the latest state from the server and notifying the user.","If data loss issues are found, switch the synchronization strategy from automatic to a manual, user-prompted merge.","Increase in 409 Conflict responses from the data synchronization endpoints in logs.","","4 weeks"
"RISK-005","External","Incorrect configuration of the AWS Cognito integration (PKCE flow) results in a non-functional or insecure authentication system, blocking all user-specific features.","Medium","High","[""TASK-052.2"",""TASK-053.1""]","3","Prototype the Cognito integration early. Use a well-established OIDC client library. Implement extensive integration testing for the login, logout, and token refresh flows.","Revert to a simpler Implicit flow temporarily to unblock development, with a mandatory task to reinstate PKCE before production.","High error rates on the Cognito token endpoint. E2E tests for login and registration failing consistently.","","2 weeks"
