"Cross-training","Single point of failure for all DevOps and Infrastructure tasks (devops.engineer@company.com).","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for the DevOps engineer to pair-program with the backend developer on CI/CD workflow maintenance and Terraform modules.","30% reduction in key-person dependency risk. Enables backend developer to handle minor CI/CD adjustments independently.","16","6 weeks","Backend developer can successfully diagnose and fix a common CI pipeline failure without assistance.","Reduced project delay risk from DevOps bottleneck, valued at over $20,000."
"Task Reallocation","Frontend Developer 1 is overallocated for Sprint 2 due to the high complexity of the auth tasks, creating a risk of burnout and delays.","Re-assign non-critical UI tasks from Sprint 1 (e.g., TASK-001.2, TASK-012.1) from frontend.dev2 to frontend.dev1 to front-load their work, freeing up more capacity for them in Sprint 2.","Balances the workload across sprints, reducing the utilization of frontend.dev1 in Sprint 2 from 51% to a more manageable 40%.","","Immediate (Sprint 1 planning)","More even distribution of allocated hours across both frontend developers in Sprint 1 and 2.","Mitigates risk of delay on critical path auth features, preventing a potential one-week slip."
