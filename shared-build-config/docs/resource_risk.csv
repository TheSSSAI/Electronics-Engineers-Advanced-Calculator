"RISK-R001","Resource","The project relies on a single backend developer for all NestJS, database, and security-critical sandbox work. Any delay, departure, or unavailability of this person will halt project progress.","High","Critical","[""TASK-BE-AUTH-JWT-01"",""TASK-BE-CRUD-MODES-01"",""TASK-BE-SANDBOX-01"",""TASK-BE-EXEC-01""]","4","Hire a second backend developer (contractor or full-time) to parallelize work and create redundancy.","De-scope features to reduce backend workload, starting with offline sync and then custom modes.","Backend tasks show >15% variance from estimates for one sprint.","40000","4 weeks to hire and onboard."
"RISK-R002","Skill Gap","The team lacks specialized expertise in security sandboxing (`isolated-vm`), which is a high-risk area. Automated testing alone is insufficient to guarantee security.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-BE-SANDBOX-01""]","2","Budget and schedule for a third-party penetration test focused on the Lambda sandbox.","Disable the custom mode feature via a feature flag if a vulnerability is found post-launch.","Internal code review cannot resolve security concerns about the sandbox implementation.","25000","4 weeks for audit and remediation."
