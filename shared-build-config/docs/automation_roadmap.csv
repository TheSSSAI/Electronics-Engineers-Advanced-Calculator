"Phase 1: CI Foundations (Sprints 1-2)","High","4","200","Jest; Supertest; Snyk; CodeQL","120","Very High - Enables rapid feedback on every commit.","4 hours/month average","8","GitHub Actions workflow configuration; SonarQube integration.","95% of builds have test results in < 5 minutes. Critical security vulnerabilities block builds.","CI environment stability; Flaky unit tests.","Containerized build agents; Flaky test quarantine process.","Improves code quality and security from the start. Increases developer velocity."
"Phase 2: Critical Path E2E (Sprints 3-4)","High","4","30","Cypress; cypress-axe","100","High - Automates regression testing for core user journeys.","8 hours/month average","16","Cypress Dashboard integration; Staging environment test user seeding.","90% automation success rate for E2E suite. Critical path regression suite runs in < 15 minutes.","UI changes breaking selectors; Test data management complexity.","Use `data-testid` attributes; Implement a test data factory.","Ensures core features work before every release, enabling confident deployments."
"Phase 3: Advanced Scenarios (Sprint 5+)","Medium","6","20","Cypress (Network Interception); k6","80","Medium - High effort to automate complex scenarios, but critical for quality.","10 hours/month average","24","Performance testing environment; Dedicated test data for offline tests.","Offline sync and conflict resolution tests are stable and passing. Performance benchmarks are consistently met.","Complexity of network interception tests; Cost of performance environment.","Pair programming on complex tests; Infrastructure as Code for perf environment.","Validates resilience and performance NFRs, ensuring a high-quality user experience."
