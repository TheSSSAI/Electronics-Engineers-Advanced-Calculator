"RISK-001","Technical","A zero-day vulnerability or improper configuration in the `isolated-vm` library could allow a malicious user-defined formula to escape the sandbox, leading to arbitrary code execution on the AWS Lambda, data exfiltration, or denial of service.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-029 (Secure Formula Execution Service), WI-030 (Custom Mode Execution Backend Endpoint), EPIC-004 (User-Extensible Custom Modes)","The inherent risk of executing untrusted code, combined with reliance on a single third-party library for security isolation.","1. Implement strict resource limits (memory, CPU, timeout) on the Lambda function itself as a secondary containment layer. 2. Ensure the Lambda's IAM role has zero permissions beyond what is absolutely necessary (e.g., CloudWatch Logs). 3. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm` and the Node.js V8 engine. 4. Schedule a third-party penetration test specifically targeting sandbox escape vectors.","Implement a feature flag to immediately disable the custom formula execution endpoint at the API Gateway level if a critical vulnerability is discovered. This will halt the feature while a patch is developed.","Unusual Lambda execution patterns (high duration, high memory usage, or error spikes) detected in CloudWatch. A new CVE is published for `isolated-vm`.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The offline synchronization logic, particularly the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution, is complex and prone to edge cases. Bugs could lead to silent data loss or data corruption for users with intermittent connectivity, severely damaging user trust.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-020 (Set up IndexedDB), WI-021 (Implement Offline Interceptor), WS-006 (Offline Synchronization)","Complexity of managing distributed state between the client (IndexedDB) and server, especially with potential race conditions and clock skew.","1. Implement a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress network interception to simulate various offline/online scenarios, including conflicts. 2. Ensure all mutable data records have a server-authoritative `updated_at` timestamp. 3. Log all sync conflicts on the server for auditing and debugging. 4. Use a well-established library or pattern for the queuing and sync mechanism.","If automatic sync proves unreliable, develop a user-facing UI that shows the pending offline queue and allows the user to manually retry syncs or discard local changes.","An increase in API requests resulting in HTTP 409 Conflict responses. User support tickets reporting data discrepancies between devices.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","A delay in completing a foundational epic, such as User Account & Data Persistence (EPIC-002), will cause a cascading delay across all dependent features, including Custom Modes (EPIC-004) and settings persistence, jeopardizing the overall project timeline.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-004 (User-Extensible Custom Modes), WI-019 (Frontend Persistence Integration), WS-006 (Offline Synchronization)","Sequential nature of the project's critical path, where high-value features are blocked by the completion of core infrastructure and authentication.","1. Prioritize and fully resource foundational epics at the start of the project. 2. Define clear API contracts early (using OpenAPI) so frontend teams can work against a mocked API (e.g., using MSW) in parallel with backend development. 3. Break down large epics into smaller, independently deliverable stories.","If a core epic is significantly delayed, re-plan subsequent sprints to focus on independent, non-user-specific features (e.g., enhancing built-in electronics modes) to maintain development velocity.","Any user story on the critical path is not completed within its planned sprint. The completion date of EPIC-002 is forecast to slip by more than one week.","Project Manager","2024-06-01","In Progress"
"RISK-004","External","A new, critical security vulnerability is discovered in a key third-party dependency (e.g., `isolated-vm`, `nestjs`, `express`), forcing an immediate halt to feature development to address the security issue. This unplanned work could delay the project schedule.","3","5","15","High","All development activities, as a critical patch would take precedence over all other work.","Heavy reliance on open-source software, which has an inherent risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities.","1. Integrate automated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) scanning (e.g., Snyk, npm audit) into the CI pipeline, configured to fail the build on new critical vulnerabilities (REQ-1-048). 2. Maintain a process for regularly updating dependencies. 3. Choose dependencies with active maintenance and good security track records.","Establish a 'hotfix' process for rapidly testing and deploying a security patch. Communicate transparently with stakeholders about the reason for the priority shift.","The CI pipeline fails due to a new critical vulnerability detected by the SCA scanner. A security advisory is released for a core project dependency.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Automated security scanning is insufficient to validate the security of the formula execution sandbox. Without specialized manual penetration testing, subtle sandbox escape vulnerabilities could be missed, leading to a critical security breach post-launch.","3","5","15","High","WI-029 (Secure Formula Execution Service), Quality assurance phase.","Over-reliance on automated tools for a highly specialized security problem (sandboxing untrusted code).","1. Allocate budget and time in the project schedule for a third-party security audit or internal red team exercise focused exclusively on the Lambda sandbox. 2. Develop a suite of 'evil' custom formulas designed to probe for common escape vectors as part of the E2E test suite.","If a vulnerability is found, immediately disable the custom mode feature using a feature flag until a patch can be developed, tested, and deployed. The release will proceed without the custom mode feature.","Internal security review raises concerns that cannot be disproven by automated tests. Project approaches release without a manual security audit of the sandbox.","Project Sponsor / Head of Engineering","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","A faulty database migration script is deployed to production, causing data corruption or leaving the database in an inconsistent state. This could block the deployment, cause an outage, and require a difficult manual rollback or database restore.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-051 (Implement Deployment Job), all database migration tasks (WI-037, WI-038, WI-039).","Insufficient testing of migration scripts against a production-like environment and data set.","1. Mandate that every deployment to the staging environment runs its migrations against a recently restored snapshot of the production database. 2. Ensure every migration script has a corresponding, tested `down` script for rollback. 3. All migration scripts must be peer-reviewed by a senior developer or DBA.","Document a clear disaster recovery procedure: 1. Halt the deployment. 2. Run the `down` migration script. 3. If `down` fails, restore the database from the automated RDS snapshot taken just before the deployment began (leveraging PITR).","The 'Database Migration' step in the CI/CD pipeline fails for the staging or production environment. Monitoring alarms for database connectivity or application errors trigger immediately post-deployment.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project relies on specialized expertise in AWS architecture, NestJS, and `isolated-vm`. The departure of a key engineer with this knowledge could significantly slow or stall development in critical areas, leading to major timeline delays.","2","4","8","Medium","EPIC-004 (Custom Modes), EPIC-006 (DevOps & Infrastructure)","Concentration of critical, specialized knowledge in one or two team members.","1. Enforce a policy of pair programming on all high-complexity tasks (e.g., sandbox implementation, Terraform setup). 2. Maintain high-quality documentation for architecture and deployment processes. 3. Conduct regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions on critical system components.","Have a budget for bringing in external contractors or consultants with the required expertise on short notice if a key person departs unexpectedly.","Project velocity drops significantly in a specific area (e.g., backend, infrastructure) for more than a sprint. Only one developer is consistently picking up tasks in a critical technology.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-30","In Progress"
"RISK-008","Performance","AWS Lambda cold starts for the formula execution service may cause the P95 latency to exceed the 500ms NFR (REQ-1-043), leading to a poor user experience for the custom modes feature. This is especially likely under sporadic load.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-029 (Secure Formula Execution Service), Performance testing activities.","The serverless execution model is subject to cold starts when functions have not been recently invoked.","1. Perform load testing early in the development cycle specifically targeting the formula execution endpoint to measure cold start impact. 2. If latency targets are missed, enable AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency to keep a number of instances warm. 3. Optimize the Lambda package size to reduce initialization time.","If Provisioned Concurrency is too costly or ineffective, investigate refactoring the execution logic to run within the main ECS service, accepting the reduced security isolation as a trade-off.","CloudWatch P95 latency alarm for the formula execution Lambda function breaches the 500ms threshold. Initial load testing results show frequent cold starts impacting performance.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
