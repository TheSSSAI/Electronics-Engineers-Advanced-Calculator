"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the offline synchronization logic could lead to silent data loss or corruption for users who modify data on multiple devices or while their connection is intermittent.","High","High","[""T025"",""T027""]","3","Implement a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress to simulate various offline/online scenarios. Add UI notifications to inform the user when their local change was overwritten.","Prioritize re-architecting the sync mechanism to use a more robust strategy like version vectors or a CRDT library.","An increase in customer support tickets related to 'lost variables' or 'modes not saving'.","20000","4 weeks to re-architect"
"RISK-002","Technical","A sandbox escape vulnerability in the user-defined formula execution service (T044) could allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the AWS Lambda environment.","Low","Critical","[""T044""]","1","Conduct a rigorous security review of the Lambda implementation. Enforce a minimal-privilege IAM role with no network access. Keep `isolated-vm` library updated.","Immediately disable the custom formula execution API endpoint. Rotate all application secrets.","Unusual activity in CloudWatch logs for the execution Lambda.","50000","1 week to patch"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The complexity of implementing the Offline Synchronization feature is significantly underestimated, leading to major project delays.","High","High","[""T025"",""T027""]","4","Conduct a time-boxed technical spike to de-risk implementation and refine estimates. Prioritize a 'Minimum Viable Product' version (e.g., offline sync for history only).","Engage stakeholders early to negotiate de-scoping less critical features from the v1.0 release.","The technical spike for the feature exceeds its time box.","30000","2 weeks to re-plan"
