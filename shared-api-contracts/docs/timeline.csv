"As-Is Plan - High Risk","5","10","191760","High","28","Heavy reliance on senior developers for all complex tasks, creating bottlenecks.","10","50","Senior FE (fe.dev.2) and Senior BE (be.dev.2) are single points of failure for high-complexity tasks.","The provided plan has significant gaps and imbalances, leading to high risk.","60","High",""
"Optimized Plan - Balanced Load","5","8","153408","Medium","65","Requires proactive cross-training and pair programming.","7","70","None identified, tasks are load-balanced.","Re-balance sprints to have a mix of FE/BE work. Assign underutilized BE/DevOps capacity to build out test automation and monitoring infrastructure earlier. Use pair programming for complex tasks (T027, T044) to mitigate key person dependency.","85","Low","1"
