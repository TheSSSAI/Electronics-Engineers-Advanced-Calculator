"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the offline synchronization logic, particularly in the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution, could lead to silent data loss or corruption for users who modify data on multiple devices or while their connection is intermittent. This erodes user trust and can cause irreversible loss of their custom modes or variables.","4","4","16","High","WI-012 (Offline Queuing), WI-013 (Background Sync), US-060 (Sync Offline Data), REQ-1-015 (Conflict Resolution)","The inherent complexity of managing distributed state, handling race conditions, and ensuring data consistency with a simple timestamp-based conflict resolution strategy across clients with potentially unsynchronized clocks.","1. Implement a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress to simulate various offline/online scenarios, including multi-device conflicts. 2. Enhance client-side logging to record sync operations and conflicts in IndexedDB for easier debugging. 3. Add UI notifications to inform the user when their local change was overwritten by a newer version from the server.","If data loss proves to be a recurring issue, prioritize re-architecting the sync mechanism to use a more robust strategy like version vectors or a CRDT library. In the short term, provide a manual 'force refresh from server' option for users experiencing issues.","An increase in customer support tickets related to 'lost variables' or 'modes not saving'. A high rate of 409 Conflict responses from the sync API endpoint.","Backend Lead","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","A sandbox escape vulnerability in the user-defined formula execution service could allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the AWS Lambda environment. This could lead to data exfiltration, compromise of application secrets, or denial-of-service attacks against other infrastructure components.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-018 (Secure Formula Execution Lambda), US-047 (Use Custom Mode), REQ-1-018 (Sandbox Environment)","Reliance on a single library (`isolated-vm`) for security isolation. An unknown vulnerability in the library or improper implementation could create an escape vector.","1. Conduct a rigorous security review of the Lambda implementation, focusing on the `isolated-vm` configuration. 2. Enforce a minimal-privilege IAM role for the Lambda with no network access, no filesystem access, and no permissions to other AWS services. 3. Keep the `isolated-vm` library and Node.js runtime consistently updated to the latest security patches.","In case of a suspected breach, immediately disable the custom formula execution API endpoint via API Gateway. Rotate all secrets and credentials accessible from the backend environment. Trigger a forensic analysis of CloudWatch logs and Lambda execution records.","Unusual activity in CloudWatch logs for the execution Lambda, such as unexpected errors, long execution times, or any outbound traffic attempts if networking were ever misconfigured.","Security Lead","2025-05-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The complexity of implementing the Blue/Green deployment strategy and the Offline Synchronization feature is significantly underestimated. This could lead to major delays in the project timeline, pushing the release date back and potentially causing budget overruns.","4","4","16","High","WI-035 (Blue/Green Deployment), WI-012 (Offline Queuing), WI-013 (Background Sync), EPIC-002, EPIC-005","These are known, industry-wide complex problems. Blue/Green requires careful orchestration of infrastructure, and offline sync requires handling numerous edge cases and race conditions.","1. Conduct time-boxed technical spikes for both features to de-risk the implementation and get a more accurate effort estimate. 2. Prioritize a 'Minimum Viable Product' version (e.g., offline sync for history only, simpler B/G script) and plan to iterate. 3. Maintain a 20% buffer in the project plan for these specific epics.","If delays become unavoidable, engage stakeholders early to negotiate de-scoping less critical features from the v1.0 release. If Blue/Green is the blocker, revert to a simpler (but higher-risk) rolling update strategy for the initial release and re-prioritize B/G for a subsequent release.","The technical spike for either feature exceeds its time box. The first implementation sprint for these features fails to deliver its planned scope.","Project Manager","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","A failure in the automated CI/CD pipeline, particularly during the database migration or traffic-switching phase of a deployment, could lead to production downtime or leave the application in an inconsistent state (e.g., new code with an old database schema).","3","5","15","High","WI-034 (Automate DB Migrations), WI-035 (Blue/Green Deployment)","The deployment process is a complex orchestration of multiple dependent steps (migration, terraform apply, health checks, traffic switch). A failure at any step without a proper rollback procedure is high-risk.","1. Implement automated smoke tests that run against the 'green' environment post-deployment but pre-traffic-switch. 2. Design all database migrations to be backward-compatible so that the 'blue' version of the code can still run against the migrated schema. 3. Implement a one-click rollback mechanism in the GitHub Actions workflow to revert the traffic switch.","Maintain a well-documented manual rollback procedure for emergency use by the on-call engineer. This involves manually changing ALB listener rules or Route 53 weights and re-deploying the previous container version.","A high rate of failed deployment runs in the CI/CD pipeline for the staging environment. Any deployment that requires manual intervention to succeed.","DevOps Lead","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Frequent AWS Lambda cold starts for the formula execution service result in high latency, failing to meet the P95 < 500ms performance requirement (REQ-1-043). This makes the custom mode feature feel sluggish and unresponsive to users, diminishing the value of a key differentiator.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-018 (Secure Formula Execution Lambda), WI-020 (Execution Endpoint), US-047","Lambda functions naturally have cold starts when invoked infrequently. The `isolated-vm` library and other dependencies might increase the initialization time, exacerbating the issue.","1. Optimize the Lambda package size by using a bundler (e.g., Webpack) and removing all unused dependencies. 2. Implement AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency via Terraform to keep a specified number of execution environments warm. 3. Conduct load testing early to determine the required level of concurrency.","If performance targets still cannot be met cost-effectively, re-architect the execution service to run on a persistent AWS Fargate container, accepting the higher idle cost in exchange for consistently low latency.","P95 latency alarms in CloudWatch for the execution Lambda are consistently breached during testing or in production. User feedback complains about the speed of custom modes.","Backend Lead","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","The application fails to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (REQ-1-034), particularly in dynamically generated UIs like the custom mode wizard and launched mode views. This makes the product unusable for users with disabilities, opens up legal risks, and may require extensive and costly remediation work post-launch.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-001, WI-021, WI-023, US-062, US-063","Lack of developer expertise in accessibility best practices. Failure to incorporate accessibility testing into the regular development workflow, treating it as an afterthought.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing tools (e.g., `axe-core` with Cypress) into the CI pipeline. 2. Mandate accessibility-focused peer reviews for all new UI components. 3. Conduct regular manual testing using screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation for all user flows.","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility hardening' sprint prior to the v1.0 release to address all identified gaps. If significant issues remain, engage a third-party accessibility auditing firm to provide a detailed report and remediation guidance.","Automated accessibility tests in the CI pipeline start failing. Manual QA sessions reveal significant keyboard navigation or screen reader issues.","Frontend Lead","2025-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","An authorization logic flaw in the backend API allows a user to access or modify data belonging to another user. For instance, crafting a request with a known custom mode ID could bypass ownership checks, leading to a severe data privacy breach.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-008, WI-019, US-056, REQ-1-030","Inconsistent or missing authorization checks in the service layer of the API. Relying on client-side information for security decisions instead of the server-validated user identity from the JWT.","1. Implement a standardized authorization pattern, such as a base repository method or service layer check that always includes a `where user_id = :currentUserId` clause. 2. Develop a dedicated suite of integration tests that explicitly try to cross user boundaries (e.g., User A tries to GET/PUT/DELETE User B's resource). 3. Mandate security-focused code reviews for all backend pull requests.","If a breach is discovered, immediately revoke all user sessions. Take the affected endpoints offline. Notify affected users as required by data protection regulations (GDPR/CCPA). Conduct a full security audit to identify and patch all similar vulnerabilities.","Any successful API call where the `user_id` on the resource does not match the `sub` claim in the JWT token (requires detailed logging and audit).","Backend Lead","2025-05-15","Not Started"
