"Resource Utilization","Backend and DevOps resources are highly underutilized in the current plan (avg <20% utilization).","Re-balance sprints to include backend/DevOps work earlier (e.g., monitoring, logging, CI/CD hardening). Implement cross-training program where BE developers contribute to E2E test automation.","Increased team velocity by ~15%. Reduced key-person dependencies. Mitigated boredom/disengagement risk for underutilized team members.","20","Ongoing","All team members achieve >60% utilization each sprint. Number of developers capable of running/writing E2E tests increases from 2 to 4.","Improved velocity reduces project timeline by ~1 week, saving ~$15,000 in operational costs."
