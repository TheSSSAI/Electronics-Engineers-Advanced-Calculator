"Phase 1: CI & API Validation","High","4","80","Jest, Supertest, GitHub Actions","200","Very High - Enables CI quality gates and blocks bad merges.","5 hours/month","8","CI/CD pipeline integration, Test DB service containers.","100% of API endpoints have integration tests. CI pipeline runs on every PR.","Initial setup complexity of CI runners and service containers.","Use documented patterns for GitHub Actions and Docker.","Massively reduces regression risk and improves developer velocity."
"Phase 2: Critical E2E Journeys","High","6","25","Cypress","150","High - Automates critical user workflows, reducing manual regression time by 90%.","10 hours/month","16","Cypress Dashboard integration, parallel test runners.","Critical path E2E tests pass reliably with <5% flakiness.","Test flakiness due to timing issues, brittle selectors.","Follow Cypress best practices (data-cy attributes, `cy.intercept`).","Ensures critical business flows are always functional, increasing release confidence."
"Phase 3: Performance & Security Scans","Medium","8","15","k6, OWASP ZAP, Axe-core","100","Medium - Proactively catches NFR violations before they hit production.","4 hours/month","24","Dedicated performance environment, security scan integration into CI.","Performance baselines established. No new critical security/accessibility issues are introduced.","Complexity of configuring and interpreting scan results.","Start with baseline scans and iterate. Use tools with clear reporting.","Reduces risk of performance degradation, security breaches, and legal issues from non-compliance."
