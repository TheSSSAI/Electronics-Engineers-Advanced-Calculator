"RISK-001","Technical","The offline data synchronization logic, especially the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution, is notoriously complex. There's a high probability of edge cases (e.g., rapid online/offline toggling, sync interruption) leading to data loss, duplication, or corruption for the end-user.","4","4","16","High","Implementation of offline capabilities for user history, variables, and custom modes (EPIC-005, REQ-1-014, REQ-1-015).","Inherent complexity of managing distributed state between client (IndexedDB) and server, coupled with unreliable network conditions.","1. Implement comprehensive E2E tests using Cypress that simulate offline/online transitions and trigger conflict scenarios. 2. Use optimistic UI updates with clear visual indicators for 'Syncing', 'Synced', and 'Sync Failed' states. 3. Ensure all server-side updates are idempotent.","If synchronization fails persistently for a specific item, mark it as 'Sync Failed' in the UI and provide a manual 'Retry Sync' option for the user. Implement robust server-side logging of all sync attempts and failures for rapid debugging.","An increase in API 409 Conflict responses on data update endpoints. CloudWatch alarms on server-side logs that detect sync-related error patterns.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Operational","A failure during the automated database migration step in the CI/CD pipeline could leave the database in an inconsistent, partially-migrated state, causing a production outage. Rolling back a failed schema change can be complex and time-consuming.","3","5","15","High","All backend deployments involving schema changes (WI-001-02-03, REQ-1-062).","Tight coupling between application code deployment and stateful database schema evolution in an automated pipeline.","1. Enforce a strict policy that all migration scripts must be backward-compatible and reversible. 2. Run migrations against a restored production snapshot in the staging environment before every production deployment. 3. Use a database connection pooler that allows for draining connections from the 'Blue' environment before running migrations.","Execute a pre-tested rollback plan: 1. Immediately halt the deployment. 2. Restore the database from the automated pre-migration snapshot. 3. Reroute all traffic back to the 'Blue' environment. 4. Post-mortem analysis of the failed migration script in a lower environment.","A non-zero exit code from the `typeorm migration:run` command in the GitHub Actions workflow log.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Security","The custom formula execution relies entirely on the `isolated-vm` library for sandboxing. A zero-day vulnerability in this library could allow a malicious user to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the Lambda environment, leading to a critical security breach.","2","5","10","Medium","Secure Formula Execution Service implementation and operation (WS-004-01, REQ-1-018).","Delegation of a critical security control (sandboxing untrusted code) to a single, third-party open-source library.","1. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm` and its V8 dependency. 2. Run automated SCA scans in the CI/CD pipeline that fail the build on new critical vulnerabilities in this package. 3. Ensure the Lambda execution role has absolute minimal IAM permissions (e.g., only CloudWatch logs, no network/DB access).","If a critical vulnerability is discovered: 1. Immediately disable the custom formula execution endpoint via API Gateway. 2. Work on an emergency patch to update the library. 3. If a patch is not available, investigate alternative sandboxing solutions or temporarily disable the custom mode feature entirely.","Security alerts from GitHub Dependabot or Snyk for the `isolated-vm` package. Unusual activity or error patterns in the execution Lambda's CloudWatch logs.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The project contains multiple high-complexity, critical-path epics (Infrastructure, Auth, Offline Sync, Custom Modes). A delay in any one of these foundational epics will have a cascading delay effect on the entire project timeline, significantly pushing back the release date.","4","4","16","High","Overall project delivery timeline, particularly EPICS-004 and EPIC-005 which depend on EPIC-001, EPIC-002, and EPIC-003.","High degree of interconnectedness between complex features and a high number of 'Critical' or 'High' complexity work items.","1. Prioritize and complete the foundational epics (IaC, CI/CD, Core Frontend Shell, Auth) first. 2. Break down large work items into smaller, independently deliverable tasks. 3. Conduct weekly dependency reviews and adjust sprint plans proactively. 4. Allocate float/buffer time after each major epic completion.","Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) scope that defers less critical, high-complexity features (e.g., Offline Sync could be v1.1) to secure an initial release date if major delays occur. Communicate timeline impacts to stakeholders early and transparently.","Any work item on the critical path being more than 20% behind its estimated effort at the sprint's midpoint. Key deliverables from prerequisite epics not being met by their target sprint end date.","Project Manager","2025-03-01","In Progress"
"RISK-005","Security","A bug in the backend API's authorization logic could fail to properly scope database queries to the authenticated user's ID. This could lead to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability, allowing one user to access or modify another user's data (history, variables, modes).","3","5","15","High","Implementation of all CRUD API endpoints for user data (WI-003-01-03).","Potential for developer error in consistently applying user ID scoping on every database query across dozens of different service methods.","1. Implement a global data scoping mechanism (e.g., a reusable TypeORM repository wrapper or query scope) that automatically adds the `WHERE user_id = :currentUserId` clause. 2. Mandate that all API integration tests include a negative test case where User A attempts to access User B's resource and asserts a 403/404 response. 3. Conduct mandatory security-focused code reviews for all data-accessing code.","If a vulnerability is found, immediately deploy a hotfix that hardens the authorization checks. Perform a full security audit of all API endpoints. Analyze logs to determine if the vulnerability was exploited and notify affected users if necessary, following a pre-defined incident response plan.","This is difficult to monitor proactively. The best trigger is a failed security test in the CI pipeline. Post-launch, an external penetration test would be a detective control.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The AWS Lambda cold start latency for the formula execution service might cause the end-to-end P95 latency to exceed the 500ms requirement (REQ-1-043). This will result in a sluggish user experience for the application's key differentiator feature.","4","3","12","Medium","Formula Execution Service performance (WI-004-01-01, WI-004-03-03).","The on-demand, serverless nature of AWS Lambda, which does not keep function instances perpetually warm without specific configuration.","1. Implement provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function in the production environment to ensure a pool of warm instances is always available. 2. Optimize the Lambda package size by removing unused dependencies. 3. Conduct load testing early in the development cycle to measure P95 latency and tune provisioned concurrency levels.","If P95 latency is still not met, a 'Lambda warmer' (a scheduled CloudWatch event that pings the function every few minutes) can be implemented as a lower-cost alternative. As a last resort, re-architect the feature to run in a dedicated, always-on ECS Fargate task, trading cost-efficiency for guaranteed low latency.","CloudWatch metrics for the Lambda function showing P95 duration exceeding ~400ms (leaving ~100ms for API Gateway and network overhead). Alarms configured on the P95 latency metric.","DevOps Lead","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","The requirement for WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (REQ-1-034) is stringent and can easily regress. New features or changes to existing components might introduce accessibility issues (e.g., incorrect ARIA attributes, keyboard traps, poor color contrast) that go unnoticed.","4","3","12","Medium","All frontend UI development (EPIC-002, EPIC-004, EPIC-005).","Accessibility is a cross-cutting concern that requires constant vigilance and specialized knowledge, and it's easy for developers to overlook during feature development.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing (e.g., Axe-core) into the E2E test suite, failing the build on critical violations. 2. Create a mandatory accessibility checklist as part of the pull request template for all UI changes. 3. Conduct periodic manual audits using screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) on key user flows.","If a major accessibility regression is discovered post-release, prioritize a hotfix. Allocate dedicated developer time each quarter for an 'accessibility sprint' to address accumulated minor issues and update components to the latest accessibility best practices.","A failed accessibility scan in the CI/CD pipeline. Bug reports from QA or users related to keyboard navigation or screen reader compatibility.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2025-03-15","In Progress"
