"RISK-R001","Key Person Dependency","The DevOps Lead is a single point of failure for all foundational infrastructure (IaC) and CI/CD setup, which is on the critical path in Sprint 1. Any unavailability will halt the project.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-WI-001-01-08-01"",""TASK-WI-001-01-02-01"",""TASK-WI-001-01-03-01"",""TASK-WI-001-01-04-01""]","2","Mandate pair programming sessions with the Backend Lead on critical Terraform modules. Ensure all IaC is thoroughly documented.","Engage a pre-vetted on-demand DevOps contractor if the lead becomes unavailable for more than 2 days.","Sprint 1 IaC tasks are more than 1 day behind schedule.","10000","1 week to onboard contractor."
"RISK-R002","Skill Gap","A zero-day vulnerability in `isolated-vm` could require immediate, expert-level security response that the team may not possess, halting the custom mode feature (RISK-003).","Low","Critical","[""TASK-US-047-01""]","4","Ensure Lambda has zero network access and minimal IAM permissions. Automate dependency scanning to provide early alerts.","Disable the custom formula execution endpoint immediately via API Gateway. Have a pre-defined communication plan for users of the feature.","Critical vulnerability alert from Snyk or Dependabot for `isolated-vm`.","","2 weeks to patch or disable."
"RISK-R003","Key Person Dependency","The Backend Lead is the only resource capable of implementing complex, security-critical features and performing security reviews, creating a significant bottleneck.","High","High","[""TASK-US-047-01"",""TASK-WI-003-01-04-01"",""TASK-US-054-01""]","3","Offload standard CRUD endpoint development to a cross-trained developer or a new hire. Prioritize the Lead's time for architecture, security, and complex logic.","Add a Mid-level Backend Developer to the team to handle less complex tasks and undergo mentoring from the lead.","Backend tasks on the critical path showing >15% time variance.","65000","4 weeks to hire and onboard."
