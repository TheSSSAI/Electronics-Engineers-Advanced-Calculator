"Cross-training","Siloed expertise in DevOps and Backend roles, creating single points of failure.","Schedule 4 hours per sprint for paired sessions: DevOps Lead to train Backend Lead on Terraform/CI-CD, and Backend Lead to train DevOps Lead on NestJS basics and API structure.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 30%. Increases team's bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical skills.","32","10 weeks","Backend Lead can independently make minor changes to the CI/CD pipeline. DevOps Lead can debug basic API issues.","Avoids potential project delays valued at over $20,000 per week."
"Task Offloading","Senior Frontend Lead is allocated to low-complexity UI tasks (e.g., TASK-US-053-01) that could be done by a Mid-level developer.","Re-assign standard component and form-building tasks from the FE Lead to the FE Developer.
