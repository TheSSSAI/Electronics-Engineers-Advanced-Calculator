Requires deep understanding of OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with PKCE.","Use a simpler OAuth flow (Implicit), but this is strongly discouraged for SPAs due to security risks.","Incorrect implementation can lead to severe security vulnerabilities like token interception.","Mandatory security code review by Backend Lead. E2E tests must validate PKCE parameters in network requests.","1.85","2.46","0.62","4","2"

Requires expertise in secure sandboxing and mitigating code execution vulnerabilities.","Using a different sandboxing library like vm2 is explicitly prohibited due to known vulnerabilities.","A zero-day vulnerability in `isolated-vm` could lead to a sandbox escape (RISK-003).","Implement with absolute minimal IAM permissions. Subscribe to security advisories for the library. Conduct thorough security reviews.","2.15","2.86","1.43","6","3"

Requires robust state management to avoid data loss or corruption.","Implement a simpler 'offline mode' with read-only data and disable all modifications, but this fails to meet core requirements.","High probability of edge-case bugs leading to data loss for users (RISK-001).","Develop an extensive E2E test suite simulating network failures and conflicts. Implement clear UI state indicators for syncing status.","2.51","3.34","1.67","8","4"
