"Cross-Training & Redundancy","Single points of failure exist for DevOps (1 person) and Backend (1 person) skill sets.","Implement a formal cross-training plan. Dedicate 4 hours/sprint for the Backend Developer to pair with the DevOps Lead on infrastructure tasks. Dedicate 4 hours/sprint for Frontend Developers to review backend PRs.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 50%. Increases team's bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical skills.","8","Ongoing","At least two team members can independently deploy a minor change or debug a CI/CD pipeline failure by Sprint 6.","Avoids potential 2-4 week project delay if a key person is unavailable, saving an estimated $20,000-$40,000 in opportunity and recovery cost."
"Workload Balancing","Frontend workload is unevenly distributed in early sprints, with one developer at 133% utilization while another is at 93%.","Re-allocate smaller tasks (e.g., STORY-069, STORY-070) to the less-utilized developer. Mandate that large (>=8 SP) stories like STORY-061 and STORY-063 are broken down and pair-programmed by both frontend developers.","Balances utilization to <100% for all resources, reducing burnout risk and improving predictability. Promotes knowledge sharing on complex features.","2","Sprint 1","Sprint 1 and 2 utilization for all developers is between 80-95%. No task spillover due to resource overload.","Prevents a likely 1-week schedule slip in early sprints, preserving project momentum and stakeholder confidence."
