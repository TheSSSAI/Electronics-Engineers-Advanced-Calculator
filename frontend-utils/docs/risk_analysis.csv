"RISK-001","Technical","A vulnerability in the `isolated-vm` library or an improper sandbox implementation in the AWS Lambda function could allow a malicious user-defined formula to escape the sandbox, leading to data exfiltration, denial of service, or compromise of the execution environment.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-3001 (Implement isolated-vm Sandbox Logic), WI-2006 (Implement Endpoint for Secure Formula Execution)","Reliance on a single, complex library for security isolation of untrusted, user-provided code, which is a significant architectural attack surface.","Preventive: Strictly enforce the function/constant allow-list (REQ-1-019). Conduct rigorous, security-focused peer reviews of all sandbox code. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm` and its dependencies and maintain a rapid patching process.","Implement a feature flag and an API Gateway configuration that allows for the immediate disabling of the custom formula execution endpoint if a zero-day vulnerability is discovered.","A new CVE is published for the `isolated-vm` library or V8 engine. A sudden spike in Lambda execution errors or security-related logs.","Lead Backend Developer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The complexity of the offline-first synchronization logic (using IndexedDB and 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution) could lead to bugs causing silent data loss, data duplication, or corruption of a user's state (history, variables) during network transitions.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-4008 (Implement Offline Support and Data Synchronization)","Handling numerous edge cases in network connectivity, managing client-side queues robustly, and implementing a correct conflict resolution strategy is inherently complex and error-prone.","Preventive: Develop a comprehensive suite of E2E tests using Cypress network interception to simulate various offline/online scenarios, including rapid toggling. Implement robust client-side logging to capture sync state transitions and errors for easier debugging.","Develop a support runbook and tooling for manually inspecting and correcting a user's corrupted data in the database if a critical bug is found post-launch.","User support tickets reporting missing or duplicated data. Spikes in 409 Conflict or 5xx errors on sync-related API endpoints.","Lead Frontend Developer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The end-to-end latency for custom formula execution may exceed the 500ms P95 requirement (REQ-1-043) due to AWS Lambda cold starts, negatively impacting the user experience of a key, performance-sensitive feature.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-3001 (Implement isolated-vm Sandbox Logic), WI-2006 (Implement Endpoint for Secure Formula Execution)","The serverless, on-demand nature of AWS Lambda means the first request to an idle function container incurs a startup penalty, which directly impacts latency.","Preventive: Configure AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for the production environment to keep a set number of function instances warm. Optimize the Lambda deployment package size to reduce initialization time.","If Provisioned Concurrency proves too costly or insufficient, a fallback plan is to re-architect the feature to use a dedicated, small, and auto-scaling ECS Fargate service instead of Lambda.","P95 latency alarm in CloudWatch for the formula execution API endpoint is triggered. Load testing results show a failure to meet the 500ms NFR.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","An error in the Terraform configuration (e.g., overly permissive IAM roles, incorrect security group rules) could expose sensitive data or services to unintended access, creating a major security vulnerability with a wide blast radius.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-001 (all work items), especially WI-1001, WI-1002, WI-1004","The complexity of managing dozens of interconnected AWS resources and permissions as code, combined with the potential for human error during script development.","Preventive: Mandate peer reviews for all Terraform pull requests. Integrate automated IaC scanning tools (e.g., `tfsec`, `checkov`) into the CI/CD pipeline to fail builds on critical security misconfigurations. Strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege for all IAM roles.","Maintain a documented ""break-glass"" procedure for emergency manual intervention via the AWS console. Utilize versioned Terraform state to allow for quick rollbacks of infrastructure changes.","An IaC security scanner fails a build in the CI pipeline. A critical finding is reported by AWS Security Hub or Trusted Advisor.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The project's success is heavily reliant on complex Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) and CI/CD pipelines. A single individual (e.g., ""DevOps Lead"") may be the only expert, creating a critical path dependency and project bottleneck if they become unavailable.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-001 (all work items)","Concentration of specialized DevOps knowledge in a single team member without a formal knowledge-sharing or redundancy plan.","Preventive: Mandate pair programming for all critical infrastructure and pipeline work. Implement a strict ""documentation-as-you-go"" policy for all Terraform modules. Formally cross-train at least one backend developer on the CI/CD pipeline and basic Terraform administration.","Pre-approve a contract with a third-party DevOps consulting firm that can be activated for emergency support.","Pull request review history consistently shows only one person approving all infrastructure-related changes. Lack of updated documentation for new infrastructure components.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","An improperly configured Service Worker caching strategy could prevent users from receiving critical application updates, leaving them stuck on an old, potentially buggy version of the frontend. This is a common and difficult-to-debug PWA issue.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-4008 (Implement Offline Support and Data Synchronization)","The inherent complexity of the Service Worker lifecycle (install, activate, fetch) and cache invalidation strategies can easily lead to race conditions or stale caches.","Preventive: Use a well-established library like Workbox (via `vite-plugin-pwa`) to manage the Service Worker. Implement a clear UI notification that prompts users to refresh when a new version of the app is available and has been downloaded in the background.","Provide a clear, documented procedure in the help system for users to manually unregister the Service Worker and clear their browser cache as a last resort recovery step.","An increase in support tickets reporting that a newly deployed feature is not visible to some users after a release.","Lead Frontend Developer","2024-07-30","Not Started"
