"RISK-R001","Technical","A zero-day vulnerability or improper configuration of `isolated-vm` could allow malicious user-defined formulas to escape the sandbox, leading to arbitrary code execution on AWS Lambda.","Medium","High","[""B-TSK-029"",""B-TSK-030"",""B-TSK-031""]","4","Implement multi-layered security: minimal IAM role for the Lambda, strict resource limits, and static analysis of formulas. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm`.","Immediately disable the custom formula execution feature at the API Gateway level if a vulnerability is disclosed.","High rate of errors from the execution Lambda; alert from SCA scan in CI/CD pipeline.","","1 week to implement patch."
"RISK-R003","Quality","Bugs in the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution logic could lead to silent data loss or corruption for users with intermittent connectivity, severely damaging user trust.","High","High","[""B-TSK-027""]","2","Develop a comprehensive suite of E2E tests using mocked offline/online transitions and simulated conflict scenarios. Ensure timestamps are generated server-side.","Implement a feature flag to remotely disable the offline modification feature for all users if a major data corruption bug is found.","High rate of 409 Conflict responses from the sync API endpoint; increase in user support tickets related to 'lost data'.","","2 weeks to debug and patch."
"RISK-R008","Resource","The project relies on a single specialist (backend.dev3) for the critical `isolated-vm` sandbox implementation, creating a single point of failure and a project bottleneck.","Medium","High","[""B-TSK-029"",""B-TSK-030"",""B-TSK-031""]","3","Enforce pair programming between the specialist and the lead developer for the most complex tasks. Mandate internal documentation and a knowledge-sharing session.","Maintain a budget for an external Node.js security consultant who can be brought in on short notice to fill the skill gap.","Velocity drops significantly on sandbox-related tasks. Bus factor analysis shows a score of 1.","10000","4 weeks to onboard consultant."
