"RISK-001","Technical","A zero-day vulnerability or improper configuration of the `isolated-vm` library could allow malicious user-defined formulas to escape the sandbox, leading to arbitrary code execution on the AWS Lambda, data breaches, or denial of service.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-027 (Secure Formula Execution Lambda), WI-029 (API Endpoint for Execution), All custom mode features (EPIC-005).","The core business requirement of allowing users to execute arbitrary code necessitates a complex and high-stakes security control (sandboxing) which is a single point of failure for system security.","1. Implement multi-layered security: a minimal IAM role for the Lambda (no DB/network access), strict resource limits (memory/timeout), and static analysis of formulas before execution. 2. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm` and Node.js. 3. Implement automated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the CI/CD pipeline to flag vulnerabilities.","In case of a disclosed vulnerability, immediately disable the custom formula execution feature at the API Gateway level. Prepare a patch release by either updating the library or temporarily disabling the feature until a fix is available.","1. High rate of errors or timeouts from the execution Lambda in CloudWatch. 2. Automated alert from SCA scan (e.g., Snyk, npm audit) in the CI/CD pipeline. 3. Public disclosure of a vulnerability in `isolated-vm`.","Security Lead / Lead Backend Dev","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Incorrect implementation of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE flow for Cognito integration could lead to security vulnerabilities such as authorization code interception, replay attacks, or insecure token storage, compromising user accounts.","3","5","15","High","WI-016 (Implement Frontend OAuth Flow), WI-017 (Backend JWT Validation), EPIC-003 (User Authentication).","The complexity of the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow and the criticality of secure token management on the client-side (SPA) create a high potential for subtle but severe implementation errors.","1. Use a well-vetted, maintained library (e.g., AWS Amplify Auth or a certified OIDC client) rather than implementing the flow from scratch. 2. Conduct a mandatory security code review specifically focused on the authentication flow and token handling logic. 3. Store tokens in-memory only, not in localStorage.","If a flaw is discovered post-launch, immediately rotate Cognito User Pool client secrets. Force a global user logout by invalidating all refresh tokens, requiring all users to re-authenticate under the patched flow.","Unusual patterns in authentication logs in Cognito, such as a high rate of failed token exchange requests or requests from unexpected user agents.","Lead Frontend Dev / Security Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","The logic for offline data synchronization, especially the 'last-write-wins' conflict resolution for mutable data, is highly complex. Bugs could lead to silent data loss or data corruption for users with intermittent connectivity, severely damaging user trust.","4","4","16","High","US-060 (Sync offline data), US-055 (Persist variables), REQ-1-014, REQ-1-015.","Managing distributed state between a client (potentially offline) and a server is inherently complex, with numerous edge cases related to network transitions, multiple devices, and timestamps.","1. Develop a comprehensive suite of E2E tests using Cypress that specifically mock offline/online transitions and simulate conflict scenarios. 2. Implement robust logging on both client and server for sync operations to aid debugging. 3. Ensure timestamps are generated server-side for all final state changes to create an authoritative timeline.","If a major data corruption bug is found, implement a feature flag to remotely disable the offline modification feature for all users. Provide a tool for affected users to view conflicting data versions and manually resolve them.","CloudWatch alarms for a high rate of 409 Conflict responses from the sync API endpoint. An increase in user support tickets related to 'lost data' or 'changes not saving'.","Lead Frontend Dev / Lead Backend Dev","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The setup of the comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and the multi-stage CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions with Blue/Green deployment) is a large, complex prerequisite. Delays in this foundational work will create a cascading delay for all feature development and testing.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-002 (Infrastructure, CI/CD, and DevOps), WS-003, WS-004. This is a dependency for all deployment-related activities.","High complexity and significant number of interconnected components in the DevOps and infrastructure setup create a large surface area for configuration issues and unforeseen challenges.","1. Allocate dedicated DevOps expertise from the project's outset. 2. Prioritize a 'Minimum Viable Pipeline' that automates test and build, and deploy a simplified version of the infrastructure first. 3. Iterate on the pipeline to add security scans, Blue/Green deployment, etc., in parallel with feature development.","Develop and document a semi-automated script-based deployment process that can be used for initial environment setups if the fully automated pipeline is significantly delayed. This reduces the immediate blocking impact.","The 'Infrastructure as Code' epic (EPIC-002) is not completed by the end of the second sprint. Key pipeline features (e.g., successful deployment to staging) are not functional by the third sprint.","DevOps Lead / Engineering Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Performance","The custom formula execution service may fail to meet the strict P95 < 500ms latency requirement due to AWS Lambda cold starts, especially under sporadic load patterns. This would result in a sluggish user experience for a key differentiator feature.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-027 (Secure Formula Execution Lambda), REQ-1-043 (Performance NFR).","The inherent nature of serverless 'scale-to-zero' functions is a period of high latency (cold start) for the first invocation after a period of inactivity.","1. Implement performance load testing specifically targeting the formula execution endpoint early in the development cycle. 2. Optimize the Lambda package size and dependencies to reduce cold start time. 3. Implement a 'warmer' (e.g., a CloudWatch scheduled event that pings the Lambda every 5 minutes) in staging to assess its effectiveness.","If performance targets are still not met, enable AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for the production environment. This will eliminate cold starts at the cost of a fixed monthly fee, which must be approved by the project sponsor.","CloudWatch metrics for the Lambda function show P95 duration consistently exceeding 400ms during load tests. User feedback reporting that custom calculations feel 'slow'.","Lead Backend Dev / DevOps Lead","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","A bug in the backend API where a database query for user-specific data (history, variables, modes) fails to include a `WHERE user_id = ?` clause would result in a critical data leakage vulnerability, exposing one user's private data to another.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-019, WI-020, WI-028 (All CRUD endpoints for user data).","Human error during development in a system with multi-tenancy. A single missed condition in a query can compromise the entire data segregation model.","1. Create a reusable data access/repository layer that automatically scopes all queries to the user ID from the request context. 2. Implement a mandatory peer review checklist item for all PRs that touch data access logic to explicitly verify user-scoping. 3. Write specific integration tests that authenticate as User A and attempt to access resources of User B, asserting that a 403/404 is returned.","If a data leak is discovered, immediately take the service offline. Identify and patch the vulnerable endpoint(s). Perform a database audit to determine the scope of the exposure and follow the incident response plan, including user notification if necessary.","This is difficult to monitor proactively. A key detective control is a robust suite of automated authorization tests that run on every build. A user support ticket reporting seeing someone else's data is a critical incident trigger.","Lead Backend Dev","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","The requirement to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA is non-trivial and requires continuous effort. If accessibility is treated as an afterthought, it could result in the need for significant and costly UI rework late in the project timeline to achieve compliance.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-004 (Accessibility Foundation), and all other frontend UI work items (e.g., WI-015, WI-024, WI-026, WI-031).","Lack of developer expertise in accessibility best practices and the tendency to prioritize visual design and functionality over non-functional requirements like accessibility.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing (e.g., Axe) into the CI pipeline and fail builds on critical violations. 2. Establish accessibility as a mandatory part of the 'Definition of Done' for all UI stories. 3. Conduct periodic manual audits using screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) and keyboard-only navigation.","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility debt' sprint before the v1.0 launch to address any accumulated issues. If issues are severe, the launch date may need to be postponed to ensure compliance.","Automated accessibility scans in the CI pipeline begin to fail. Manual audits reveal systemic issues (e.g., poor focus management, unlabeled controls).","Lead Frontend Dev / QA Lead","2025-05-30","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","The project requires a combination of highly specialized skills (Terraform, AWS ECS/Lambda, NestJS, `isolated-vm`, advanced React). The departure of a key person with this expertise, or a lack of sufficient skill depth on the team, could create a single point of failure and severely impact project velocity.","2","4","8","Medium","All major epics (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-005).","Over-reliance on a small number of 'hero' developers for critical, complex components of the system without sufficient knowledge sharing.","1. Enforce pair programming for the most complex tasks (e.g., sandbox implementation, CI/CD pipeline setup). 2. Mandate internal documentation and knowledge-sharing sessions for critical system components. 3. Cross-train team members by rotating ownership of different modules between frontend, backend, and DevOps.","Maintain a budget for external expert consultants who can be brought in on short notice to fill a critical skill gap. Keep project documentation up-to-date to reduce the ramp-up time for new team members.","Project velocity drops significantly on tasks related to a specific technology area. Bus factor analysis shows a score of 1 for any critical component.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-28","Not Started"
