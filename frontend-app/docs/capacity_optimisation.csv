"Cross-training","Single point of failure on `isolated-vm` expertise (backend.dev3).","Mandate pair programming sessions between backend.dev3 and backend.dev1 on tasks B-TSK-029 and B-TSK-030. Require backend.dev3 to host a 2-hour knowledge transfer session for the team.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 50%. Increases team's overall security expertise.","20","2 weeks","Lead developer (backend.dev1) is able to independently review and approve PRs related to the sandbox implementation.","Avoids potential project delays valued at >$50,000 if the specialist becomes unavailable."
"Load Balancing","Backend Developer (backend.dev2) has significant buffer capacity (54%) compared to others.","Re-assign non-critical path, low-complexity tasks from Sprint 2 (e.g., B-TSK-036, B-TSK-038) from backend.dev3 to backend.dev2 to free up specialist time for critical path work.","Reduces bottleneck on the specialist, potentially accelerating the critical path of the custom modes feature.","2","1 day","Utilization of backend.dev2 increases to >60% while backend.dev3 decreases, improving team balance.","Potential to bring forward custom mode feature completion by 1-2 days."
