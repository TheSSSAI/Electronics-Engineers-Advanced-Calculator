"TEST-SEC-001","Security & Data Isolation","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that an authenticated user (User A) cannot access, modify, or delete data (custom modes, variables, history) belonging to another user (User B) via direct API calls.","Critical - Data leakage between users would be a catastrophic privacy breach, destroying user trust and causing legal issues.","Medium","Two distinct user accounts (User A, User B) exist. User B has existing data (e.g., a custom mode with a known ID).","1. Authenticate as User A to obtain a valid JWT. 2. Craft API requests (GET, PUT, DELETE) for resources belonging to User B, using User B's resource IDs. 3. Send the requests with User A's JWT in the Authorization header. 4. Assert that the API responds with a 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found for every request.","API must return a 403 or 404 status code.

In a separate process (e.g., API call), update 'x' to 30 on the server to simulate another device's sync. 4. Go online. 5. Observe the sync process. 6. Assert that the UI updates to show 'x' as 30 (server authoritative). 7.
