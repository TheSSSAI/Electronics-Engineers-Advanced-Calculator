"Phase 1: CI Foundations & Critical Path (Sprints 1-2)","High","4","200","Jest, Supertest, Cypress, GitHub Actions","200","Very High - Enables CI/CD and provides immediate feedback on core, high-risk features.","5 hours/sprint","8","CI integration for unit/integration tests, test database setup.","98% CI test pass rate, all PRs automatically tested.","Initial setup of test database seeding can be complex.","Use TypeORM seeding tools, start with a minimal data set.","Accelerates development feedback loop, catches critical bugs early."
"Phase 2: E2E Coverage Expansion (Sprints 3-4)","Medium","4","150","Cypress, k6","180","High - Reduces manual regression testing effort significantly before release.","10 hours/sprint","","Staging environment stabilization, performance test environment setup.","80% of user stories covered by E2E tests, baseline performance tests established.","E2E tests can be flaky if UI is not stable.","Use stable selectors (`data-testid`), implement retry logic for flaky tests.","Increases release confidence, reduces time-to-market."
"Phase 3: Post-Launch Optimization (Ongoing)","Low","8","100","Cypress","120","Medium - Covers edge cases and less frequent user flows.","15 hours/sprint","","Production monitoring integration with test alerts.","95% of all identified regression scenarios are automated.","High maintenance cost for low-impact tests.","Regularly review and prune low-value, high-maintenance tests.","Improves long-term product quality and stability."
