"RISK-002","Quality","Achieving WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is a major cross-cutting effort. Treating it as a final-stage 'fix-it' task will cause massive rework and release delays.","Critical","Critical","[""TASK-US063-02"",""All frontend tasks""]","3","Integrate automated `axe-core` testing into CI from Sprint 1. Make accessibility compliance a mandatory item in the Definition of Done for all UI stories.","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility hardening' sprint before the release candidate. Engage an external accessibility consultant if major issues are found late.","Automated accessibility violations increase over two consecutive sprints.","20000","Ongoing"
"RISK-003","Technical","The offline data synchronization logic is inherently complex. Bugs in handling IndexedDB, conflict resolution, or edge cases could lead to permanent user data loss.","High","High","[""TASK-US060-01"",""TASK-US060-02"",""TASK-US060-03"",""TASK-US060-04"",""TASK-US060-05""]","2","Develop a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress to simulate various offline/online scenarios. Implement robust client-side logging for sync events.","Provide a user-facing UI with a manual 'Retry Sync' button. Develop a support runbook for diagnosing sync issues.","Beta testers report more than two instances of data loss after an offline session.","10000","4 weeks"
"RISK-004","Technical","A sandbox escape vulnerability in the `isolated-vm` library could allow malicious formulas to execute arbitrary code on the server, compromising the backend.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-US047-01"",""TASK-US047-02"",""TASK-US047-04""]","4","Run the formula execution Lambda in a dedicated, highly restrictive AWS account. Enforce short timeouts and low memory limits. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm`.","Implement a feature flag 'kill switch' to immediately disable the formula execution endpoint if a vulnerability is announced.","A new CVE is published for `isolated-vm`. Anomalous execution times or memory usage are detected in CloudWatch.","30000","1 week to disable, 4 weeks to patch"
"RISK-007","Resource","Project requires specialized skills (`isolated-vm`, service workers, Terraform, WCAG). Key person dependency on senior developers creates significant bottlenecks.","Medium","Medium","[""TASK-US047-01"",""TASK-US060-01"",""TASK-US052-01"",""TASK-US063-02""]","2","Enforce pair programming for all work on critical, specialized components. Mandate thorough documentation for architecture and setup.","Have a prioritized list of features that can be de-scoped if a resource bottleneck cannot be resolved. Allocate budget for a short-term consultant.","A single developer is consistently the only person able to review PRs in a specific domain.","25000","Ongoing"
