"RISK-001","Timeline","The 'User-Extensible Custom Modes' epic (EPIC-005) is identified as 'Critical' complexity. There is a very high probability of underestimating the effort for the secure sandbox, multi-step wizard, and dynamic UI rendering, which could cause significant project-wide timeline slippage.","5","4","20","High","WI-021, WI-022, WI-023, WI-024, WI-025 and all dependent features.","Inherent complexity of creating a secure, user-friendly, and robust framework for executing untrusted user code and dynamically rendering UIs from it.","1. Decompose the epic into the smallest possible vertical slices. 2. Timebox an initial technical spike to validate the `isolated-vm` integration and the dynamic form rendering approach. 3. Prioritize a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) version of the feature with limited functionality (e.g., text inputs only) to de-risk the core components early.","Define a de-scoped version of custom modes (e.g., without import/export or advanced UI controls) as a fallback for the v1.0 release. Maintain transparent communication with stakeholders about the complexity and potential for timeline adjustments.","Velocity on initial stories for the epic is 20% lower than estimated for two consecutive sprints. The initial technical spike fails to produce a viable proof-of-concept within its timebox.","Project Manager / Tech Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","Achieving and maintaining WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (REQ-1-034) is a cross-cutting effort that is frequently underestimated. If treated as a final-stage 'fix-it' task instead of an ongoing process, it will require massive, costly rework and could delay the release.","5","5","25","Critical","All frontend work items (WI-001, WI-011, WI-014, WI-015, WI-024, WI-025, etc.)","Accessibility is a specialized discipline that affects every UI component's structure, styling, and behavior. Retrofitting is significantly more expensive than building it in from the start.","1. Integrate automated accessibility testing (`axe-core`) into the CI pipeline from the first sprint. 2. Make accessibility compliance a mandatory item in the Definition of Done for all UI-related stories. 3. Conduct regular (bi-sprintly) manual audits using keyboard-only navigation and screen readers (NVDA/VoiceOver).","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility hardening' sprint in the project plan before the release candidate. If major issues are found late, engage an external accessibility consultant for rapid remediation guidance.","The number of automated accessibility violations in the CI pipeline increases over two consecutive sprints. A manual audit reveals critical issues in a core user flow.","Lead Frontend Engineer / QA Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The offline data synchronization logic (REQ-1-014, WI-020) is inherently complex. Bugs in handling the IndexedDB queue, conflict resolution ('last-write-wins'), or edge cases like browser closure during sync could lead to permanent user data loss or duplication.","4","4","16","High","WI-019, WI-020, EPIC-004, and all features relying on data persistence (History, Variables, Custom Modes).","Managing state transitions between online and offline, ensuring data integrity during synchronization, and handling network unreliability are notoriously difficult problems in web applications.","1. Develop a comprehensive E2E test suite using Cypress to simulate various offline/online scenarios. 2. Implement robust logging on the client-side for sync events and failures. 3. Use a well-established library (e.g., 'idb') to abstract IndexedDB complexities.","If automated sync proves unreliable, provide a user-facing UI element that shows the number of pending offline items and includes a manual 'Retry Sync' button. Develop a support runbook for diagnosing sync issues from client-side logs.","Internal QA or beta testers report more than two instances of data loss after an offline session. The number of 'failed sync' log events exceeds a predefined threshold.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The security of the custom mode feature hinges entirely on the `isolated-vm` library (REQ-1-018). A sandbox escape vulnerability in this third-party library could allow malicious user-provided formulas to execute arbitrary code on the server, compromising the backend environment.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-021, WI-023, EPIC-005.","Executing untrusted, user-supplied code is an inherently high-risk activity that relies on the integrity of the sandboxing mechanism.","1. Run the formula execution Lambda function in a dedicated AWS account with highly restrictive IAM permissions (no database access, minimal network access). 2. Strictly enforce short timeouts and low memory limits on the Lambda function to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks. 3. Subscribe to security advisories for `isolated-vm` and the V8 engine.","Implement a feature flag and an API Gateway configuration to immediately disable the formula execution endpoint if a critical vulnerability is announced. This will act as a 'kill switch' to contain the threat while a patch is developed.","A new CVE is published for `isolated-vm`. CloudWatch monitoring detects anomalous execution times or memory usage for the sandbox Lambda function.","Lead Backend Engineer / Security Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The Blue/Green deployment strategy (REQ-1-072) is complex to orchestrate. A failure in the CI/CD pipeline during the traffic-switching step could route all users to a non-functional 'green' environment, causing an extended production outage.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-006, all production deployments.","Complexity of coordinating multiple systems (GitHub Actions, Terraform, AWS ECS, Route 53/API Gateway) in a live production environment.","1. Implement automated, comprehensive health checks against the 'green' environment that must pass before traffic is switched. 2. Thoroughly test the entire deployment and rollback process in a dedicated 'staging' environment that mirrors production. 3. Initially, use a canary release strategy (e.g., routing 5% of traffic) to validate the 'green' environment under production load before a full switch.","Develop and document a manual, emergency rollback procedure that can be executed by the on-call engineer within 15 minutes. Ensure deployment logs are detailed enough to quickly diagnose the point of failure.","Automated health checks on the 'green' environment fail. CloudWatch alarms for 5xx errors or high latency spike immediately after a traffic switch.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Timeline","The project has a complex chain of dependencies (e.g., frontend auth UI depends on backend auth service which depends on Cognito IaC). A delay in any foundational component, such as the core AWS infrastructure (WI-003), will have a cascading delay effect on multiple dependent workstreams.","3","5","15","High","Nearly all development tasks.","Tightly coupled dependencies in the initial phases of a project with a full-stack, infrastructure-as-code approach.","1. Map out the critical dependency path for the first 4-6 sprints. 2. Prioritize the foundational infrastructure and backend API contracts (IaC, Cognito, JWT Guards) in the earliest sprints. 3. Use mocked API responses (e.g., using MSW) on the frontend to allow parallel development before the backend APIs are fully deployed.","If a foundational component is significantly delayed, immediately re-prioritize the backlog to focus the team on independent, unblocked workstreams to maintain productivity. Re-evaluate the project timeline and communicate the impact to stakeholders.","A work item on the critical path is delayed by more than 50% of its estimated time. The completion date for a foundational epic (e.g., EPIC-001) is pushed into a later sprint.","Project Manager","2024-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project requires a diverse and specialized skill set, including `isolated-vm` security, service worker PWA, advanced Terraform, and WCAG accessibility. A key person dependency or skill gap in any of these areas could create a significant bottleneck and compromise quality.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-021 (Sandbox), WI-016 (Offline), WI-004 (IaC), WI-034 (Accessibility).","Concentration of highly specialized knowledge in a small number of team members without adequate cross-training or documentation.","1. Enforce pair programming for all work on critical, specialized components. 2. Mandate thorough documentation for the setup and architecture of these components. 3. Allocate budget for specialized training or for bringing in a short-term consultant if a critical skill gap is identified.","Have a prioritized list of features that can be de-scoped or simplified if a resource bottleneck cannot be resolved in a timely manner (e.g., simplify offline mode from full sync to read-only cache).","A single developer is consistently the only person able to review PRs or fix bugs in a specific domain. The project timeline shows a critical path fully dependent on one person's tasks.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-30","Not Started"
